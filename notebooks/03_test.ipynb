As she says, “If we can’t find equity in education, where else can we find it?”\\nSichuan, China\\nTradition meets technology.\\nYa’an, Sichuan, is home to the earliest tea plantations ever recorded in written Chinese. The city’s four rivers and surrounding peaks form an ideal environment for growing tea.

Cooperative leaders help develop farmers’ skillsets and promote entrepreneurial growth across China’s e-commerce ecosystem. And in 2020 Apple supported the CFPA in establishing the Mengdingshan Cooperative Development Institute to support digital skills training for more than a thousand farmers’ cooperative leaders every year.\\nCooperative director Ying Wang learned how to utilize technology and devices like iPad to farm smarter. She says that everything used to be done with paper notes, and iPad made it easier to learn the information and skills needed to improve tea production.

The institute incorporates a wide-ranging curriculum — from seasonal produce efficiencies and supply chain knowledge to marketing and ultimately how to better sell products. Farmers and entrepreneurs are able to leverage their newfound digital skills to grow even better tea for export and thrive in their local economies. Wang continues, “We’re in the age of technology and information, it’s not the traditional agricultural era anymore. Training our talents helps us achieve transformation.” Before the institute, many young people in Wang’s village typically left for the cities in search of opportunities. Now they’re choosing to stay in their villages because of thriving industry standards, access to innovative technology, and more practical training. Wang is thankful that young people are staying, and she’s hopeful that new talent will arrive in the village to help build a more prosperous community together.

As a result, income for cooperative members has increased and their digital skills are continually improving the quality of product. Ya’an’s reputation for tea is growing more and more because of each and every talented individual. Wang believes, “When we are born everyone is the same, nobody knows anything. It is only education that brings you the ability to create who you are.

They did this because the U.S. financial system has historically failed to understand and serve their needs. Acevedo and Hernandez knew they wanted to rectify this wrong by supporting their community in taking control of its finances.\\nSo along with Xavier Gutierrez, they founded SUMA Wealth. The Latina-led financial technology company, with Chief Operations Officer Hernandez, Chief Executive Officer Acevedo, and Chief Strategy and Business Development Officer Daniela Corrente, first focused on gaining their community’s trust.\\n“We want the Latino community to know, this company is built by people like you and for you,” says Hernandez.\\nCorrente adds: “Many institutions think because they put a sign in Spanish, they are going to attract people from the Latino community, but that’s not what inclusivity means.”', metadata={'url': 'https://www.apple.com/racial-equity-justice-initiative/'}),\n",

It’s about prioritizing a safe environment for her employees to create these products. After immigrating to the United States from Mexico, Castellon witnessed hazardous conditions while working her way up through the manufacturing industry. So she dedicated herself to creating a better business model.\\nThat model turned into Bench-Tek Solutions, a Silicon Valley–based manufacturing company that creates sustainably designed workplace and laboratory furniture. As the company grew, Castellon, its CEO, worked to adopt more sustainable practices. To help achieve this, she applied to the Apple Impact Accelerator program. The 12-week virtual program is designed to help scale U.S.-based Black-, Hispanic/Latinx-, and Native/Indigenous-owned businesses innovating in Apple’s key environmental focus areas: renewable energy, carbon removal, recycling innovation, and smarter chemistry.', metadata={'url': 'https://www.apple.com/racial-equity-justice-initiative/'}),\n",

As part of these efforts, they asked fellow Impact Accelerator alumnus and solar roofing company Simmitri, Inc., to install solar panels at Bench-Tek.\\n“We were interested in developing strategies and investing in technology like fiber-optic lasers and solar for increasing energy efficiency in our manufacturing. We also wanted to utilize these strategies for more energy-efficient, innovative furniture design,” she says.\\nBench-Tek’s success has elevated Hispanic/Latinx representation in Silicon Valley and the environmental sector. Castellon adds, “I love that a company such as Apple is really investing their resources and time and making an impact to create equality and inclusion for vendors like us who never had these chances before.”\\nApps made by everyone.

The criminal legal system that systemically targeted Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples needed to change. The child protection services that separated babies, children, and young people from their culture and community needed to change. And Stanley, who had witnessed these injustices firsthand, believed she could fight for that change.\\n“It’s not a child protection system because the system doesn’t protect children. It’s not a criminal justice system because the system isn’t just,” says Stanley.\\nSo Stanley and her husband, Keenan Mundine, created the Australian, Aboriginal community–led nonprofit Deadly Connections, which started in Sydney as an outreach program for Aboriginal young people who were frequently targeted by police. “The vision of Deadly Connections is to address systemic racial disparities through advocacy and various initiatives and to continue to dismantle and disrupt the harmful systems that have caused and continue to cause a lot of pain for our community,” says Stanley.', metadata={'url': 'https://www.apple.com/racial-equity-justice-initiative/'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Her outreach initially consisted of playing sports with the kids to help keep them engaged and connected. From there, Deadly Connections grew into an advocacy and support organization for adults and children affected by the child protection and criminal legal systems. “The prison experience is detrimental not only for the individual, but for the whole family and community. That’s why everything we do is grounded in culture and community. We know culture is a protective factor,” says Stanley.\\nDeadly Connections’ grassroots support includes logistical assistance for families such as ensuring that people can get to their appointments. And the nonprofit, supported by an Apple grant, helps kids and young people stay connected to their culture with one-on-one mentoring, group mentoring, and pop-up community events.\\nThe organization is also addressing systemic issues at the policy level, including supporting Raise the Age, a national campaign striving to stop Australia from locking up young children and sending them to prison. Currently children as young as 10 can be incarcerated in Australia, younger than the age set by most other countries. Stanley is advocating for all of these changes so that Aboriginal peoples don’t just survive, but thrive.\\nPainting new paths.', metadata={'url': 'https://www.apple.com/racial-equity-justice-initiative/'}),\n",

YAM is the only arts-based diversion program offered through the Orleans Parish District Attorney’s Office.
