You can play a sound on the built-in speaker by going to the new Items tab in the Find My app. Or just say “Hey Siri, find my wallet.” If it’s hiding nearby — like under the couch or in the next room — just follow the sound and\\nyour search is over.\\nIf your AirTag is nearby, your iPhone can lead you straight to it with Precision Finding.1 – which shows you the exact distance and direction to head in – thanks to built‑in Ultra Wideband technology.\\nWhen youʼve left something far behind, like at the beach or the gym, the Find My network — hundreds of millions of iPhone, iPad, and Mac devices around the world — helps track down your AirTag. And itʼs designed to protect your privacy every step of the way.\\nYour AirTag sends out a secure Bluetooth signal that can be detected by nearby devices in the Find My network. These devices send the location of your AirTag to iCloud — then you can go to the Find My app and see it on a map. The whole process is anonymous and encrypted to protect your privacy. And itʼs efficient, so thereʼs no need to worry about battery life or data usage.\\nJust like your other Apple devices, AirTag can be put into Lost Mode. Then, when it’s detected by a device in the network, you’ll automatically get a notification. You can also set it so someone can get your contact info by tapping your AirTag with their NFC-capable smartphone — that’s the same technology that lets people pay for things with their phones.\\nOnly you can see where your AirTag is. Your location data and history are never stored on the AirTag itself. Devices that relay the location of your AirTag also stay anonymous, and that location data is encrypted every step of the way. So not even Apple knows the location of your AirTag or the identity of the device that helps find it.\\nAirTag is designed to discourage\\nunwanted tracking. If someone else’s AirTag finds its way into your stuff, the network will notice it’s traveling with you and send your iPhone an alert. If you still havenʼt found it after awhile, the AirTag will start playing a sound letting you know it’s there.\\nOf course, if you happen to be with a friend who has an AirTag, or on a train with a whole bunch of people with AirTag, don’t worry. These alerts only get triggered when an AirTag is separated from its owner.\\nA one‑tap setup instantly connects your AirTag with your iPhone or iPad. Enter a name for your AirTag, attach it to the item you want to track, and youʼre good to go. Want AirTag notifications on your Apple Watch, too? No problem.\\nAirTag is designed to keep going more than a year on a standard battery you can easily replace.2 And your iPhone lets you know when itʼs time to pop in a new one.\\nLet’s say you’ve tagged your keys and — oops — drop them in a puddle. Or they’re in the path of a colossal spill. Hey, that’s okay. Your AirTag is water resistant.3\\nWhen you buy your AirTag from the Apple website or Apple Store app, you can have it personalized with your initials. An emoji. Or both. Itʼs free and easy, and it adds some fun.\\nOpen this page using Safari on your iPhone or iPad.\\nIt’s easy to attach AirTag to just about anything with colorful key rings and loops from Apple. AirTag comes individually or in a 4 pack. Happy tagging.\\nA partnership based on meticulous craftsmanship and shared values continues. Three handmade leather pieces — a luggage tag, bag charm, and key ring — each come with an exclusive AirTag Hermès etched with the iconic Clou de Selle signature.

That’s why we’re always reviewing and strengthening our machine safety programs to help keep the people who operate manufacturing equipment safe on the job. We require suppliers to design safer equipment from the start and to conduct regular trainings on topics such as the use of safety devices, inspection basics, automation safety, and hazards associated with moving parts. We also require suppliers to regularly inspect equipment and safety procedures to confirm that machines remain in safe working condition and that the rules put in place to keep people safe are being enforced and followed.

To make this happen, we’re designing our products to be less carbon-intensive, increasing our use of recycled and renewable materials, and transitioning our entire supply chain to 100 percent renewable energy. We’ll then use carbon removal to address the small amount of remaining emissions, starting with high-quality nature-based solutions, like those in Apple’s Restore Fund.\\nWe’ve also called on our suppliers to decarbonize their Apple production by 2030, and we’re helping them get there through targeted programs and training that aim to improve their energy efficiency and identify sources of high-quality renewable energy.\\nCounterclockwise from top: Supplier solar array installation, Switzerland; Apple Watch band manufacturing, Japan; Apple Watch assembly, Vietnam\\n100%\\nof Apple suppliers expected to be carbon neutral for their Apple production by 2030\\n16\\ngigawatts of renewable energy operational in the Apple supply chain\\nUP NEXT\\nEnvironment\\nEnvironmental rights are human rights.\\nResponsibly managed forest, Austria\\nResponsibly managed forest, Austria\\nEnvironmental rights are human rights.\\nThe global impacts of climate change are becoming more apparent by the day.

Through our Clean Water Program, we’re helping suppliers reduce their water usage, promote water recycling, and prevent water pollution. Since the launch of this program in 2015, 20 of our suppliers’ facilities have achieved certification through the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS), the world’s leading water stewardship organization.

Effectively disassembling and recycling our products after their use is also a key part of our work to support a circular economy. These processes help recover valuable materials that can be used again, making the best use of limited resources and enabling us to design and build the next generation of devices to be even better for people and the planet. That’s why we help our suppliers efficiently and safely recycle our products, by providing Recycler Guides and conducting assessments to verify that they’re meeting our standards.\\nWe maintain strict standards for the responsible sourcing of materials — whether primary or recycled.

Because belonging takes all of us.\\nFor many team members and customers in the deaf and hard-of-hearing community, sign language interpretation is critical — but having an interpreter on hand isn’t always an option. So a diverse group of people across multiple teams at Apple came together to provide access to interpretation on short notice.\\n“We felt strongly that we needed to solve the question, ‘How can we facilitate communication with our deaf and hard-of-hearing colleagues and customers in the way that works best for them?’”\\nTraditional in-person sign language interpretation services require booking in advance and are challenging to scale, especially in the context of customer service and internal teams. So this cross-functional group collaborated to create an experience that would be a viable and immediate alternative for Apple customers and employees alike.\\n“We considered not just what would be adequate support, but what would really deliver an experience that recognizes and embraces people’s differences and cultures,” says Antony Kennedy, People Accessibility.\\nThe result of these efforts is SignTime. SignTime helps people communicate with AppleCare and Retail Customer Care in their web browsers using American Sign Language (ASL) in the United States and Canada, British Sign Language (BSL) in the United Kingdom, and French Sign Language (LSF) in France. In 2023, the service launched in Australia, Japan (where it is known as HandTime), Germany (where it is known as SignChat), Spain, Italy, and Korea. In addition to in-person interpreters, customers visiting Apple Store locations can use SignTime to access a sign language interpreter remotely without booking ahead of time.\\n“At Apple, we provide tools for our team to do their best work. Equitable access to language is especially powerful within the deaf community, and SignTime is a step forward in that direction,” says Gus Shitama, Global Accessibility Policy and Initiatives.\\nSignTime has already made a difference in how the team connects — both with each other and with customers. “After SignTime was released, I felt a stronger sense of belonging because it bridged the communication gap that previously existed,” says Ricky Winarta, Apple Carnegie Library. “This made it easier to build relationships, removed any unnecessary barriers when typing back and forth with customers and coworkers, and made the customer’s experience better.”\\nSince our earliest days, inclusivity has been fundamental to our design process.\\n“Inclusion is not something you can tack on at the end, or do once at the beginning and you’re done; it’s an ongoing effort to constantly improve the experience that everyone has and it’s done to make people’s lives better.”\\nWe consider inclusivity at every step — and this work requires close collaboration among a wide range of teams. One such effort involved Face ID, where cross-functional teams came together to ensure that our machine learning model had extensive, diverse data. This meant taking into account a huge range of facial feature variations and coverings in order to build something that works for people with light or dark skin, for people of every age, for all kinds of facial shapes, and for people who are fully sighted, blind, or have low vision.\\nOur focus on inclusive design remains a priority — and we’re working to be even more inclusive. Jerremy Holland, Joshua Cohen of Apple University, and Denise Hui of AIML created the Inclusive Products Initiative – an internal knowledge-sharing website and network for anyone at Apple interested in inclusive product design. As part of this initiative, the Inclusion & Diversity team developed a workflow that lets product design teams connect with Diversity Network Associations (DNAs) to review their work.\\nIn addition, Apple University created Technology for All of Us, an inclusivity course that uses case studies from inside and outside Apple to examine how to weigh the right considerations — including potential trade-offs — and ultimately make informed choices. The course description aptly sums it up: “Technology for All of Us encourages you to consider what it means to build for humanity in all its variety — and why it matters.”\\n“Our role is not to do the work for people, or to tell people what to do, or to look under the hood before something goes out the door,” says Cohen. “Our job is to empower people who have the responsibility to develop inclusive products. That is the way to create something sustainable.”\\nTogether, these efforts help inspire a culture where being inclusive by design becomes an inherent part of everyone’s process.\\nOur comprehensive benefits are designed to help every Apple employee and their family feel healthy, supported, and secure. For Veterans, navigating the transition from service to the civilian or corporate world can be tricky. Veterans@Apple and the Benefits and Wellness teams collaborated and spent time listening to the needs of the community — to ensure that every Veteran at Apple understands the full range of health, financial, and wellness benefits available to them, including tailored benefits such as military time away.\\n“We created an approach to help our National Guard, Reservists, and Veterans better understand the range of benefits, so that they can make the best decisions for their unique situations.”\\n“There are a lot of questions out there — even more for our Guards and Reservists who live in both worlds — that we can’t afford to overlook,” Rooze says.\\nMike Burtnick, Veterans@Apple and AppleCare At Home Advisor, says that raising awareness helps start important conversations and encourages Veterans to get the help they need. “Just letting people know what we offer helps bring about dialogue. It shows that it’s OK to seek help, it’s OK to talk to others about issues you may be dealing with.”\\nUltimately, the goal for Veterans@Apple and the Benefits and Wellness teams is to ensure that Veterans feel comfortable seeking the care they need, while bringing this community even closer together.\\nMeaningful progress requires more than just celebration. Which is why we’re inspired by culturally significant moments — like International Women’s Day and Pride Month — to move important conversations about inclusion forward.\\n“Stories have everything to do with building civilizations. They allow people to say, I am here.\\nI am present. I have been here.”\\nThe teams behind Apple Music, Apple Fitness, Apple News, Apple Health, Apple Global Events, and more collaborate to build campaigns that bring Apple employees together. For International Women’s Day, these teams invited women and nonbinary creators from inside and outside Apple to share their work.\\nOccasions like these give us the opportunity to rally around important causes and make a positive impact. They also create the opportunity to express shared values and be part of something bigger, together. For Pride Month, LGBTQ+ employees from Apple Retail, Engineering, and Finance all shared their personal experiences. Their stories were featured in a 2022 Pride film, Steve Jobs Theater Presents iBelong.\\nTelling these stories in an intersectional way — across race, gender, sexual orientation, and cultures — is key. “We can’t be whole unless we tell our stories in a complex and complete way,” Etwaroo says.\\nDiversity Network Association (DNA) chapters\\nOur world-class talent in Miami is dedicated to serving Latin American and U.S. Hispanic customers and communities. They’re also key in making sure we consider diverse perspectives in everything we do.\\n“Diverse representation is core to how we think as a company. And having more Latinos in our workforce and leadership is key.”\\nAddressing the needs of these communities and providing meaningful access to technology — and to the opportunities that technology provides — requires deep collaboration. “We are passionate in making this initiative an important pillar inside of Apple, across everything we do,” says Alberto Escobedo, Marketing, ALAC (Apple Latin America and Caribbean), Canada, and U.S. Hispanic. “We found that bringing together a wide group of leaders from various areas of the organization makes a huge difference. It sparks inspiration and creativity, and motivates our teams. The impact of the work has been truly rewarding.”\\nThe teams in Miami and Latin America also rolled out local Diversity Network Associations (DNAs) — including Black@Apple, Pride@Apple, and Women@Apple — as a way to enable connections, encourage conversation on topics that matter, and provide access to helpful resources. All three chapters have continued to grow month after month, with overall membership increasing by 138 percent by the end of 2022.\\n“I’m especially proud of our team’s drive, engagement, and participation in these newly formed communities,” says Laura Veronica Gonzalez, People, Latin America Corporate. “The work, passion, and energy of our team to continue to build our culture of belonging is inspiring. This is truly representative of how we cultivate innovation at Apple.”\\nOur New Silicon Initiative (NSI) is working with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to help inspire, prepare, and create opportunities for more Black students to enter careers in hardware technology — a critical and fast-growing field.\\nNSI began in 2018 as an ongoing partnership between Apple and educational institutions. In 2021, it expanded to include four HBCUs: Alabama A&M, Prairie View A&M, Morgan State, and Howard University. Each school has received Apple Innovation Grants and curricula-building support from Apple experts.\\n“With our HBCU partners, NSI is directly creating a pathway to a more diverse engineering workforce.”\\nApple provides hands-on learning exercises and course programming, and Apple engineers volunteer their time as guest lecturers. Students also receive one-on-one mentoring with the Apple volunteers.\\n“We know this will take time, but we’re energized by the strong interest from students, the collaboration with faculty, and the potential impact of the opportunities ahead of us,” Zerbe says.\\nAppleCare is known for its unparalleled customer service. And as one of the most diverse teams within Apple, it’s on a mission to champion equity and drive inclusion even deeper within its organization.\\n“The best way to serve our customers is to create even more ways to support our people.”\\nApple has a long-standing commitment to I&D, and in 2020 Farhoudi started the Inclusion & Equity at AppleCare (IEAC) program to challenge his team to create an even more inclusive environment.\\nThe team delivered, launching a dozen pilots and programs. One of the first programs was the Speaker Series, which provides a platform for AppleCare employees to have open and honest discussions about topics ranging from racism and sexism to allyship in action. The program creates a safe space for employees to show up as their authentic selves and helps create a stronger sense of belonging. Farhoudi was one of its first speakers. “To foster an empathetic and compassionate environment for our team, I try to lead with vulnerability and openness. It’s not always easy, but nothing that’s worth doing is,” he says.\\n“So many people have felt less alone,” says Kyla Cragg, IEAC. “At Apple, we believe that our differences make us stronger, and the Speaker Series is a great example. It has helped people learn from those that are different from them, and also learn that we have much more in common than we realize.”\\nAnother IEAC program, Partnerships, serves to improve representation at all levels of the AppleCare team. Through regular live sessions, employees from underrepresented communities (URCs) connect with hiring managers to gain better visibility into opportunities and hone the essential skills and qualifications needed for open roles. “This program demystifies the roles and gives people a forum to ask questions to help them gain confidence to apply,” adds Cragg.\\nSessions are promoted to Apple’s Diversity Network Associations (DNAs), and Black in AppleCare and AppleCare Latinidad, to further connect communities and foster a sense of belonging within AppleCare. The Partnerships program gives visibility to these opportunities and has led to applications from a more diverse set of candidates.\\nRepresentation within AppleCare Support\\nHardware technology is at the heart of innovation at Apple. And a big part of innovation involves including different perspectives. So the people building Mac, iPhone, and other products are working to build even more diverse teams.\\nIn 2018, Apple in Israel started working with ASAL Technologies in the Palestinian Authority (PA). Through that partnership, five engineers were initially recruited to work at the Rawabi R&D center. Now there are more than 80 engineers — and that number is growing.\\n“This work benefits not just the employees themselves, but the community and economy as a whole.”\\nFor locals like Deema Omar of Hardware Technologies, Israel, these efforts are opening doors and breaking barriers. “As an Arab, this is a strong statement from Apple to bring people together. I’m very happy and proud to hear that Apple is investing in this initiative. I speak about it as a great representation of Apple’s investment in inclusion and diversity.”\\nBlechman says: “This makes people of all backgrounds feel proud to work for an organization that stands for its values. Apple as an organization has decided to be intentionally inclusive, and this work demonstrates that.”\\nFor years, Apple employees all over the world have found community through our Diversity Network Associations (DNAs). These member-led groups are designed to inspire a culture of belonging that helps their colleagues feel supported, connected, and empowered — while also encouraging the kind of open dialogue that helps lead to stronger allyship across Apple.\\n“When we’ve spoken to people about the culture of Apple and what really stands out to them, it’s inclusion. People really feel they can be themselves here.”\\nOne way DNAs make this happen is through a partnership with the Apple Recruiting team. The team hosts résumé and interview skill-building workshops for DNA members and, when possible, informs DNAs of open roles. This collaboration also led to a page on the Careers at Apple website where DNA members share their stories with people looking for both a career and community at Apple.\\n“One person had a story about volunteering with Afghan refugees through her DNA — how it really resonated with her because she has an Afghan background. Another told a story about feeling accepted at Apple,” says Molla. “People sharing their stories, then learning about how those stories connect with people, is really powerful.”\\nBrian Rekasis of Global Recruiting Marketing has also seen the benefits of the website. “Our Careers at Apple site is one of the first ways candidates get a sense of Apple’s culture and values, and our DNAs are a huge part of that,” he says. “It’s about being seen and heard, which leads to feeling valued.”\\nIn 2021, Apple launched Today at Apple Creative Studios in Los Angeles, Beijing, Bangkok, London, Washington, D.C., and Chicago. Since then, the program has expanded to even more places around the world.\\n“Today at Apple champions the spirit of creativity for all, and what makes creativity amazing is its ability to embrace the different, the new, and what is to come.”\\nThe five-week Creative Studios program connects Retail teams with community organizations to offer learning opportunities for local groups — many of which include people from underrepresented communities. In Taipei, Today at Apple partnered with Taiwan Tongzhi Hotline Association, an LGBTQ+ nonprofit, and Pride@Apple to create a safe space for LGBTQ+ kids and teens to express and shape their own perspective of their creative selves. Through the course, a group of young creatives in the LGBTQ+ community learned how to make digital avatars, AR filters, and photo portraitures.\\nIn Beijing, Today at Apple Creative Studios is now in its second year. This team has continued to partner with the China Foundation for Rural Development to teach photography and videography to kids and teens from migrant families.\\n“Belonging means the opportunity to realize your dreams,” says Jing Yang, Today at Apple, Beijing. “For some people, a dream is just a dream. We try to make them possible.”\\nThis is just the start. A new program will be launching in 2023 in Beijing to keep youth connected to their creative passions. “I am touched by the talent of this group of youth,” says Yang. “By the end of the program, people totally change. At the beginning, they have very low voices, but at the end, people go onto the stage and share their projects. It’s a huge change.”\\nEven after they’ve completed the program, these creatives will continue to be supported through mentorship, résumé workshops, and leadership training to further help them realize their dreams.\\nWe work to ensure that our stores reflect the communities we serve. That’s why we’re increasing leadership representation across our Retail teams. The number of women globally and Black and Hispanic/Latinx leaders in the United States in Retail grew by two percentage points year over year. And since 2017, these communities grew by five or more percentage points each.\\nOne example of how we increased female representation globally is in Japan. We worked closely with women across our Japan teams to better understand what they need to succeed in leadership — then we developed an Inclusion & Diversity action plan to accelerate how we recruit and promote more women in Retail. As a result of these efforts, female representation in Japan Retail leadership increased from 12 percent in September 2017 to 30 percent as of December 2022.\\n“Diversity inspires more diversity. It’s all about visibility and showing what’s possible in order to inspire.”\\nHaving more women in leadership roles is one part of creating a representative team. Patrick Schuerpf of Retail, North and South East Asia, enlisted the help of our Inclusion & Diversity team to host unconscious bias workshops for Retail leadership. Together, these efforts empower each of us to help everyone succeed.\\nFemale representation in Japan Retail leadership\\nOur workforce is more diverse than ever. And there is more work to do.\\nWe launched Apple’s Racial Equity and Justice Initiative (REJI) to address systemic racism and expand opportunities for communities of color in three key areas: education, economic empowerment, and criminal justice reform.\\n“We’re committed to continuing to develop and strengthen strategies aimed at addressing racial inequity and injustice in the U.S.”\\nOne way we’ve expanded opportunities is by bringing the Apple Developer Academy to downtown Detroit — its first U.S. location — through a partnership with Michigan State University (MSU). The academy reaches nearly 750 participants from the Detroit metropolitan area every year, with both short-term and long-term programs that teach the fundamentals of coding, design, project management, marketing, and iOS app development. The Developer Academy is also committed to helping public high school seniors continue their education by providing them with stipends to attend the academy.\\nREJI has since expanded its work beyond the United States, including initiatives in New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Mexico.\\n“While our efforts in the U.S. remain a priority, we must also support solutions that combat systemic issues for Black and Brown people and communities around the globe,” says Johnson.\\nIn Australia, REJI has funded initiatives and community nonprofits serving Indigenous communities. One example is First Australians Capital, a national Indigenous-led organization that gives Indigenous businesses the financial knowledge and capital support needed to thrive. Another is Original Power, an Indigenous-led organization that has launched community-led renewable energy projects in the Northern Territory and beyond to help provide Indigenous communities with lower-cost, clean energy.\\nAnd in the United Kingdom, a partnership with the Southbank Centre — the U.K.’s largest multi-arts center — supports emerging Black talent. The partnership program, Reframe, provides 80 creatives from London, Manchester, and Birmingham the opportunity and resources to showcase their work and positions them for long-lasting careers in the arts. “Through partnerships, we’re using our platform to amplify the work of local organizations and communities globally, and help drive meaningful change,” says Johnson.\\nIn Mexico, Apple has been working closely with universities across the country to help set up and launch iOS Development Labs — bringing coding with Apple’s programming language, Swift, to students and preparing them for careers in Mexico’s thriving iOS app economy. With 12 iOS Development Labs across the country, these students get hands-on experience to learn Swift — ultimately creating, designing, and coding their own apps to make a difference in their communities.\\nPay equity is embedded in Apple’s approach to compensation. Since 2017, Apple has achieved and maintained gender pay equity. In the United States, we have also achieved pay equity with respect to race and ethnicity — as well as pay equity at the intersections of race, ethnicity, and gender.\\nWe don’t ask for previous salary information during the interview process. For new team members, we look at internal and external salary data and how closely a person’s skills, experiences, and qualifications match the job requirements to determine pay. And every year, we partner with an independent third-party expert to examine each team member’s total compensation and make adjustments, where necessary, to ensure that we maintain pay equity.\\nApple TV+ is committed to creating stories that reflect everyone. It’s important that our audiences can relate deeply to the characters and their lives. To achieve that, there must be representation — both behind and in front of the camera.\\nFrom stories like the Oscar-winning CODA, the multilingual drama Pachinko, and the heartwarming Cha Cha Real Smooth to real and dramatized experiences like those in Killers of the Flower Moon and Little America, inclusivity is at the core of our content.\\nAs part of our efforts, we collaborate with creators from around the world, including women’s rights activist and youngest Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai, seven-time Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton, and award-winning storytellers Alfonso Cuarón, Maya Rudolph, and Natalie Portman.\\nWe do this because we firmly believe that Apple TV+ is a destination to explore the full spectrum of the human experience. And because we believe in the power of entertainment to bring us closer together, while also helping us gain a better understanding of each other, ourselves, and the world around us.\\nPerformance reviews involve more than results — they look at how people perform their jobs. They encompass how people work with — and show up for — each other. One initiative aimed at creating a more equitable employee experience is to have inclusion and diversity considered as part of every performance review, for every person, at every level. While aspects of this work are far from new, it’s been expanded to acknowledge how team members encourage others to share their points of view, include diverse perspectives in pursuit of the best approaches or ideas, and contribute to a more inclusive environment.\\n“Every day, team members across the company are doing their part to build a more inclusive Apple. We’re further reinforcing our values by recognizing those that do this well — and holding everyone accountable for inclusion and diversity.”\\nWith close support and involvement from the executive team, Inclusion & Diversity, Talent Management, Employee and Corporate Communications, People Business Partners, and Apple University worked meticulously to ensure that the expectations are clear and that they’re applied globally.\\nOur work to make Apple more inclusive extends to the businesses we work with. The Supplier Diversity Program partners with nearly every team within Apple and is dedicated to working with suppliers from historically underrepresented communities to create a more equitable world. In the United States, we categorize diverse suppliers as Black, Hispanic/Latinx, Asian Indian, Asian Pacific, Indigenous, Women, Disabled, LBGTQ+, and Veteran owned.\\n“By working to address diversity, equity, and inclusion within our global supply chain, we’re helping to drive economic empowerment in new ways.”\\nIn October 2021, Apple was acknowledged as Corporation of the Year by the U.S.-based National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC). This distinction is NMSDC’s highest honor for companies that make it a priority to partner with ethnic minority–owned suppliers, specifically those with Black, Hispanic/Latinx, Asian Indian, Asian Pacific, and Indigenous owners.\\n“Our suppliers are not only giving back to their employees, but also to their community,” says Seto. Many of these supplier companies also have diverse teams and boards of directors.\\nAnd while there is more work to do, Scott Vowels of Supplier Diversity says “it’s heartening to see the incredible impact of our suppliers and vendors.” That’s why the Supplier Diversity team at Apple is focused on ensuring that opportunities for underrepresented groups are considered in every supply chain decision. Not only can we create greater equity, but we can help foster greater economic opportunities for everyone.\\nOver the past year, we filled more open leadership roles than ever with women globally and Black candidates in the United States. We remain committed to continuing to grow leadership representation.\\nWe’re addressing systemic racism by expanding opportunities for communities of color globally.\\nWe prioritize providing safe, respectful, supportive workplaces for everyone.\\nWe empower students and educators to learn, create, and define their own success.\\nOur built-in accessibility features are designed to work the way you do.\\nWe design every product and service to be secure and safe.\\nWe’re committed to bringing our net emissions to zero across our entire carbon footprint by 2030.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

That’s why Apple is committed to providing people around the world with more opportunities to learn through partnerships in over 100 countries and regions.\\nEducation moves learners, leaders, innovators, communities, and everyone forward.\\nNorthridge, California\\nHigher learning within reach.\\nFor most of Amanda Quintero’s childhood, going to college wasn’t an option. As the daughter of immigrant parents who weren’t familiar with higher education, the expectation was that she’d find a job once she finished high school. It wasn’t until the last semester of her senior year that a substitute teacher first encouraged her to apply to a university. That chance encounter changed her entire trajectory. It was the moment she began to believe she had what it took — that she belonged.\\nToday Dr. Quintero dedicates her career to ensuring that other first-generation college students have the same opportunities she had. A leading content expert on Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) and recognized student success innovator, Dr. Quintero currently serves as the Senior Advisor to the President for Inclusive Excellence and as the Equity Innovation Officer of the Global HSI Equity Innovation Hub at California State University, Northridge. The Global HSI Equity Innovation Hub, launched in partnership with Apple, will make a significant impact on first-generation college students throughout the nation, connecting diverse talent to opportunity. With Dr. Quintero’s visionary leadership, this initiative will work to transform HSIs nationally to increase student success and equip Latinx and other minoritized and historically excluded students with skills for careers in STEAM.\\n“This partnership with Apple is going to help us be bold and innovative about blurring the lines between the physical space, which is the hub, and the virtual space,” says Dr. Quintero. In addition to the technology and grants, Apple is providing experts to help design the space and the programming, which will be essential to position learners for success in college and in the workforce.\\nThe goal is to move the needle on equipping a largely first-generation student population with the educational experiences and skills they will need to become first-generation professionals in STEAM fields. The Global HSI Equity Innovation Hub will do this by connecting HSIs to resources, thought leaders, and one another, sharing what works to accelerate educational equity, and leading to a more inclusive and diverse future workforce. “Diverse talent is an asset that benefits us all,” says Dr. Quintero. “It’s a full circle of giving back, investing their talent with the very communities that many of the students come from to disrupt intergenerational inequity.”\\n“The first time my family ever stepped foot on a college campus was the day of my graduation,” Dr. Quintero says, “and I don’t want that to be the experience of other students.”\\nThe Global HSI Equity Innovation Hub signifies a shift in the paradigm from what students must do to be successful to what HSIs must do to serve students intentionally. It puts the onus on leadership to shine an equity lens on their structures, policies, and practices. It empowers students, faculty, and staff to transform institutions, which Dr. Quintero says is key to an effective equity-centered approach to education. The other imperative of the programming is to engage the families of first-generation college students, who are often disconnected from campus life. “The first time my family ever stepped foot on a college campus was the day of my graduation,” she says, “and I don’t want that to be the experience of other students.” Whole-family programming and outreach to students and their families will ensure that access to higher education and the completion of a degree doesn’t happen by chance.\\nCork, Ireland\\nA culture of creativity and innovation.\\nHollyhill, a suburb of Cork City in Ireland, is home to Apple’s European headquarters. It’s also the home of Terence MacSwiney Community College, a Cork Education and Training Board School serving students from ages 12 through 18. In 2015 the school’s leadership entered into a partnership with Apple.\\nAs part of this collaboration, Apple volunteers began working alongside teachers at the school to help implement the Everyone Can Code and Everyone Can Create curricula, aimed at increasing student engagement through coding and creativity. Additionally, Apple provided the necessary funding and technology so the students could have hands-on learning experiences.\\nThe partnership was a positive spark for the community. The students at Terence MacSwiney were now being exposed to the latest in technology and creativity. And from working with Apple volunteers, they started learning about careers that many of them didn’t know existed. “These very interesting people came into our school and opened the students’ minds to possibilities and dreams for themselves,” says Eva Corbett, a postprimary teacher at Terence MacSwiney Community College.\\n“A lot of the kids don’t think they’re creative until they come to the Everyone Can Create class,” Corbett says. “But they start drawing on their iPad and end up discovering a new world of innovation.”\\nCorbett, who teaches Apple curriculum-based courses, has witnessed the impact of the partnership firsthand and has numerous anecdotes of student success. One of these stories comes from an Everyone Can Code class, where students developed an app prototype called Food Fund. “The app was designed to assist with the management of a social action project, also created by students, to reduce food waste in local schools, redistribute food to a local charity called Penny Dinners, and raise awareness of food needs in our community,” says Corbett.\\nAnother story that Corbett shares is about a group of girls who wrote an original song called “Live Out Loud” in an Everyone Can Create class. The anthem they composed was so powerful that it was selected to be part of a government-led national campaign to celebrate LGBTI+ young people. The group is now using GarageBand and iMovie to produce their own music and videos. “In terms of how it will impact their future, it’ll give them confidence to try new things,” says Corbett.\\nUltimately, Corbett says, the partnership with Apple has brought a culture of creativity and innovation to Terence MacSwiney Community College. “A lot of the kids don’t think they’re creative until they come to the Everyone Can Create class,” she says. “But they start drawing on their iPad and end up discovering a new world of innovation.”\\nBoise, Idaho\\nLanguages lead the way.\\nFor many immigrants and refugees in America, joining a new community can be an overwhelming experience. Language barriers often become an enduring challenge, especially when seeking job opportunities or continuing their education. In Idaho, the Onramp initiative’s goal is to build the state’s workforce by developing Idaho educators and expanding opportunities for students. This statewide program is a unique partnership between Apple, Boise State University, the Idaho Digital Learning Alliance, and the College of Western Idaho (CWI). For CWI instructors like Sarah Strickley, helping immigrants and refugees develop more English communication skills enables them to feel closer to their communities and empowers them to make a difference. “For equity to happen, we need to educate leaders that look like the world.” Strickley says.\\nCWI’s English language learner (ELL) and English as a second language program offers free English and digital skills classes to non-native English speakers. With support from Apple’s Community Education Initiative team, this program incorporates the Everyone Can Create curriculum, an introduction to Develop in Swift, and devices to support digital skills acquisition. Strickley has been teaching ELL for over 10 years, and she designed a course within the program that teaches English through code and vice versa. She works with more than 150 students across 30 countries of origin, with more than 31 languages spoken. Students have varying educational levels and experience with technology. Some have never interacted with an iPad before, while some have advanced credentials from their home country. What they have in common is a communication barrier that limits potential job opportunities. Strickley says, “The goal is a sustainable program that every student is able to touch, no matter where they are on their educational journey.” Her approach to teaching both language and code reinforces the unique strengths and skills within every student.\\nStrickley says, “When you braid creativity, community, and coding, that’s where the magic happens because technology stands up and fills in those language or learning gaps for students.”\\nStrickley believes that creativity plays a major role in bringing people closer to their community. She incorporates Challenge Based Learning — an approach to leveraging technology to solve real-world problems — which often becomes the first interaction and connection for many of these students to their communities. They’re actively learning to make connections and creatively solve problems, while simultaneously building self-confidence and valuable social capital. Immigrants and refugees often arrive in Idaho without a network or support system, and Strickley’s efforts with CWI ultimately empower them to find their own voice and build their place in a community they now call home.\\nStrickley says, “Every one of us is a bundle of knowledge, regardless of our language, accent, background, or circumstance. And education helps us share that knowledge with each other toward more understanding.” For Strickley, technology is an equalizer that helps everyone get on the same page. With devices in hand and newfound technological knowledge, every community member has the potential to find or even create their own success.\\nJohannesburg, South Africa\\nCode that reaches new zip codes.\\nKatleho Letshae lives in Johannesburg, South Africa. When a friend told him about the Apple Coding course being offered at Wilberforce Community College, he jumped at the opportunity.\\n“It’s rare to find courses like this in developing countries,” Letshae says.\\nThe course was made possible by HBCU C2, an initiative by Tennessee State University in partnership with Apple to empower Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to bring coding and creativity opportunities to their home campuses and surrounding communities. HBCU C2 promotes innovation and education equity, and it aims to address community challenges using app design and Apple’s Swift programming language.\\nApple helped launch the program and is involved at various levels, from providing the grants and technology needed to scale the initiative to designing the curriculum and course content. Additionally, the Apple team has helped prepare instructors to teach the classes using the Apple Teacher Training curriculum.\\nTo date, the program has spread to 46 HBCUs, all of which have committed to serving as a Center of Innovation in their communities. Part of this commitment includes establishing an “Innovation Team” to implement the program locally, devising at least two courses each academic year with C2 strategies, and offering out-of-school coding and creativity learning experiences for all age groups, including K–12, after-school, and local community organizations. This shared commitment has been instrumental in creating opportunities that are diversifying the tech and creative workforce and bridging the digital divide among underrepresented minority groups.\\nHBCU C2 has been so successful that it has recently expanded beyond the United States to three schools in Africa, serving students in high school and in two-year and four-year colleges. That includes Wilberforce Community College, where 88 students have gone through the program in the first year.\\nOne of those students was Letshae. In the course, he designed an app called Seasons, which will allow people to control the temperature of their electric blankets via Bluetooth using their iPhone. While taking the course, he looked for problems he could solve in his community, and that’s how he came up with the idea. “I wanted to create an easier and safer way for people of all ages to use electric blankets,” says Letshae. While the app is still in the prototype stage, he hopes he’ll see it come to fruition one day. Meanwhile, Letshae is planning his next steps. He has continued to learn about coding beyond the course, just by being curious and researching online, but he is considering returning to school for a degree in computer science or information technology. “Education sets a foundation to elevate myself to achieve my goals.”\\nDetroit, Michigan\\nDetroit. In development.\\nOhio native Telayne Keith says, “I believe in my students so much and what they’re capable of doing. Whether they see it or not, I see it.” Keith brings a passion for education and community everywhere she goes. She’s one of many talented individuals in Detroit who are paving new paths in today’s tech-driven world. She was a facilitator in the Boys & Girls Clubs of Southeastern Michigan (BGCSM), teaching the principles of human-centered design and app prototyping.\\nIn July 2021 Apple teamed up with BGCSM and Grow Detroit’s Young Talent (GDYT) to build a program for students to develop skills for job opportunities and higher education. The six-week Code to Career program brought together a cohort of 20 students from ages 18 through 24 to take on community challenges in sustainable fashion and mobility.\\nAs a facilitator, Keith incorporated Apple’s Challenge Based Learning (CBL) — an approach to leveraging technology to solve real-world problems — and guided groups of students to identify community needs and develop creative solutions. Keith says, “We can’t build on what we already have without expanding what we know. Curiosity is so important.” Her students were able to realize their inner creative potential and how they can each make a difference. Keith reminisces about her own upbringing and how her mother used methods similiar to those of CBL to encourage finding answers through research and field trips to museums.\\nKeith says, “Education isn’t necessarily four walls and a book, it’s what you learn from the people around you who don’t look or think like you.”\\nEven though her students didn’t have coding experience, they were confidently presenting their app prototypes to judges and Michigan legislators by the end of the program. Students were able to take their problem-solving skills and collaboration experience and impact their communities. Other students continued on to join the Apple Developer Academy Foundation Program — a monthlong program and intro to coding and design — or even apply to the academy’s yearlong program.\\nThe Apple Developer Academy is a powerful engine of growth for Detroit. It’s a hub of entrepreneurship and creativity that provides training for students to be part of the iOS app economy. Keith’s passions led her to join the academy as a user experience and user interface (UX/UI) design mentor to guide and inspire students toward new opportunities in technology. She carried this drive to Kent State, graduating with a master’s degree in UX/UI in August 2022. From the BGCSM to the Apple Developer Academy, the transformational power of technology is helping to champion even more talent in Detroit.\\nKeith believes, “There’s always a way to carve out your own way through life. And education makes that possible.” Keith and the Apple Professional Learning Specialists in the BGCSM are fostering a cycle of positive development across communities in Detroit. Apple Developer Academy students are returning to their alma maters to share their journeys and inspire younger generations. GDYT intends to adopt and organically expand BGCSM’s six-week Code to Career program into a yearlong engagement for K–12 students. For Keith, “Education is truly power,” and education empowers each and every community member to develop an even greater Detroit.\\nOttawa, Canada\\nResources from the source.\\nFirst Nations history was, until recently, virtually absent from curricula in Canada. The historic and ongoing regulations of the 1876 Indian Act — which attempted to assimilate a vast, varied population of First Nations people into non–First Nations society — and the impact of residential schools that had suppressed 150,000 children from expressing their culture for generations, were often overlooked. The last Canadian residential school closed in 1997, further fueling the movement toward teaching more First Nations culture and history today.\\nIn 2015 the Assembly of First Nations (AFN) gathered First Nations education leaders across Canada from coast to coast to coast. The AFN showcased a collection of artifacts, residential school maps, and other materials to help educators teach Canadian history through a First Nations lens. Demand for this collection was overwhelming.\\nApple was inspired to kindle a partnership with the AFN to increase educational access for Indigenous and non-Indigenous students. AFN’s Director of Languages and Learning and a member of Rama First Nations, Renee St. Germain says, “Teachers and students struggle for reliable resources around culture and history.” She’s part of the ongoing project with Apple to make available digital resources related to First Nations history. The result is a downloadable resource providing hands-on educational tools on First Nations’ rights, culture, and history. The free It’s Our Time: The AFN Educational Toolkit includes a growing collection of interactive Apple Books that support Indigenous and non-Indigenous educators in embedding new perspectives into their classrooms and fostering a spirit of cooperation, understanding, and action.\\nSt. Germain says, “Education is fundamental in addressing large issues, eliminating systemic racism and discrimination. We all go through education and the system needs to be changed to properly support today’s society and cultures.”\\nApple has helped the AFN develop 15 Apple Books in English and in French. Today the combined efforts of Apple Distinguished Educators, Apple’s Community Education Initiative, pedagogical experts, Indigenous education leaders, and advocacy organizations continue to empower educators in teaching First Nations history. St. Germain believes, “There’s no bad time to start the conversation for all people, regardless of age.” Teachers are finally able to integrate First Nations into curricula effectively and spark more dialogue around this sensitive history. She says, “Equity is at the forefront of everything the AFN does, and the toolkit is First Nations–led.” She emphasizes the importance for First Nations students to see themselves accurately represented. “There are First Nations students in almost every classroom.” Systemic change is growing across Canada and the toolkit is building more momentum to make education more equitable for First Nations students and future generations.\\nSt. Germain now works on partnerships with school boards to expand the toolkit’s reach. Because First Nations people are diverse, Apple and the AFN continue to work with First Nations education leaders to develop region-specific editions of the toolkit to better reflect respective traditions, languages, and cultures.\\nAccording to St. Germain, there’s more work to be done for First Nations people — from housing to equal rights to cultural safety for students and teachers. Education is part of the process. As she says, “If we can’t find equity in education, where else can we find it?”\\nSichuan, China\\nTradition meets technology.\\nYa’an, Sichuan, is home to the earliest tea plantations ever recorded in written Chinese. The city’s four rivers and surrounding peaks form an ideal environment for growing tea. And its world-renowned homegrown tea is soon to be matched by its invaluable homegrown talent.\\nIn 2015 Apple began supporting the China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation (CFPA) to help organize farmers into cooperatives to train them to sell their products more efficiently. Cooperative leaders help develop farmers’ skillsets and promote entrepreneurial growth across China’s e-commerce ecosystem. And in 2020 Apple supported the CFPA in establishing the Mengdingshan Cooperative Development Institute to support digital skills training for more than a thousand farmers’ cooperative leaders every year.\\nCooperative director Ying Wang learned how to utilize technology and devices like iPad to farm smarter. She says that everything used to be done with paper notes, and iPad made it easier to learn the information and skills needed to improve tea production. Many of the farmers who enter the institute have never seen or used tablets before; leaders like Wang motivate them to learn because she believes technology is empowering for the community.\\n“Cooperative directors are like seeds in communities, taking root, and sprouting,” Wang echoes her teacher’s words when considering the impact of education. The institute incorporates a wide-ranging curriculum — from seasonal produce efficiencies and supply chain knowledge to marketing and ultimately how to better sell products. Farmers and entrepreneurs are able to leverage their newfound digital skills to grow even better tea for export and thrive in their local economies. Wang continues, “We’re in the age of technology and information, it’s not the traditional agricultural era anymore. Training our talents helps us achieve transformation.” Before the institute, many young people in Wang’s village typically left for the cities in search of opportunities. Now they’re choosing to stay in their villages because of thriving industry standards, access to innovative technology, and more practical training. Wang is thankful that young people are staying, and she’s hopeful that new talent will arrive in the village to help build a more prosperous community together. The CFPA is expanding the scale of the institute’s best practices to rural areas in more provinces.\\nWang says, “Education has an influence on every step we take on the journey of our life.”\\nAs cooperative director Wang studies and researches ways to better manage her cooperative and unite members. As a result, income for cooperative members has increased and their digital skills are continually improving the quality of product. Ya’an’s reputation for tea is growing more and more because of each and every talented individual. Wang believes, “When we are born everyone is the same, nobody knows anything. It is only education that brings you the ability to create who you are. Then you are safe enough to swim around and enjoy your own journey.”\\nBirmingham, Alabama\\nCommunities on the rise.\\nThere’s a saying, “The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, the second best-time is now.” And in Birmingham, Alabama, Ed Farm intends to grow digital skills and talent across the tech field for generations to come. In early 2020 Apple partnered with Birmingham City Schools, the Alabama Power Foundation, and TechBirmingham to launch Ed Farm to foster educational equity and develop the workforce of tomorrow. Opportunities and technology are now more accessible in this community-driven, education ecosystem.\\nBirmingham area residents of all ages can participate in Ed Farm in a variety of ways. The Teacher Fellows program, with the support of Apple Professional Learning Specialists, develops educators who are passionate about innovations in learning and helps them integrate Apple’s Everyone Can Code curriculum into their lesson plans. The Student Fellows program cultivates skills in middle and high schoolers through Challenge Based Learning, an approach to leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. And the Pathways Program is a free course on Apple’s Swift programming language that also promotes the attainment of postsecondary credentials. Ed Farm connects to Birmingham in a unique way as it’s supported by and for the community, all to reimagine education through technology.\\n“You’re never too old to learn something new. If you’re not learning, you’re not growing,” says Nikia Hackworth, a Pathways Program participant.\\nHackworth found Pathways to be a life-changing experience for her and her family. After a long career in the financial industry, she discovered information about Ed Farm on social media, and it piqued her interest. She says, “You can’t go wrong with learning something new” when describing her Pathways experience and how she gained more knowledge about code and technology. She began to apply these digital skills toward a new career as a business analyst. Hackworth’s role isn’t rooted in writing a coding language; it’s to speak the language that involves code as she works as a liaison between technology and business teams. Ed Farm doesn’t just teach people how to code, it demonstrates awareness that the tech field has multiple paths — from product owners to project managers to business analysts like Hackworth, and more. She firmly believes that “education will help you grow. The more you know, the more you grow.”\\nEd Farm’s impact spans K–12, higher education, and the workforce — helping to transform Birmingham into a southern Silicon Valley. This partnership shines a light on opportunities Birmingham residents may not have known existed and opens new doors for growth. According to Hackworth, “In order to grow, we have to get out of the small box we might find ourselves in, and go into another box where we could blossom to be the big tree that we’re supposed to be.”\\nOur education story doesn’t end here.\\nBuilding a future where every girl can learn and lead.\\nIn 2018 Apple partnered with Malala Fund to help scale the organization’s work for girls’ education and equality. In providing support for Malala Fund grants, technology, curriculum, and research, Apple is accelerating progress toward a future where every girl can access 12 years of free, safe, high-quality education.\\nRacial Equity and Justice Initiative\\nOur Racial Equity and Justice Initiative fights systemic racism by helping ensure more positive outcomes for communities of color.\\nK–12 Education\\nApple technology helps educators bring out the creativity in students with powerful products, support, and curricula for magical learning experiences.\\nCollege Students\\nPowerful and compatible with everything you need for higher education and more.

So we’re expanding opportunities for Black, Hispanic/Latinx, and Indigenous communities around the world in three key areas: education, economic empowerment, and criminal justice reform. Because creating meaningful change takes all of us.\\nEducation that powers possibility.\\nWe’re increasing support for minority-serving institutions and programs that foster skill building, technology training, and career growth. Because with more resources, more is possible.\\nFilmmakers propelled by purpose.\\nDr. Tytianna Ringstaff believes creativity is a catalyst for change. As the Artistic Director of the Black Film Institute at Simmons College of Kentucky, a Historically Black College and University (HBCU) in Louisville, she and other faculty are providing students with a platform to pursue their passion for filmmaking.\\n“We’re using storytelling to resurrect untold narratives about the Black experience. As a catalyst for change, we use art for activism to ignite critical conversations and disrupt the injustices we collectively experience,” says Dr. Ringstaff.\\nApple has invested $25 million as a founding partner of the Propel Center, a first-of-its-kind global innovation and learning hub that supports all HBCUs. With a grant from Propel, Simmons’s Black Film Institute has created programming that gives its students hands-on experience making films — including writing, filming, directing, producing, editing, and marketing them. ”We want to make sure our students are leaving with that passion and authenticity — and the opportunity to become a vehicle for social change and transformation through their own story and their own lens,” adds Dr. Ringstaff.\\nUsing Mac, iPad, and iPhone devices, as well as Final Cut Pro and iMovie editing software, the students produced and filmed the documentary series Raising Simmons: Treading the Lanes. The series pilot tells the story of 11 Black jockeys who raced in the first Kentucky Derby. ”To me it was very shocking,” says Kristen Gray, a student who worked on the film. “These first jockeys were formerly enslaved. They were some of America’s very first athletes. That story gets overlooked.”\\nBy creating these opportunities, Simmons College of Kentucky is ensuring that Black history is elevated and that more students like Gray are better positioned to pursue film careers. ”I plan to continue to write and produce my short films,” she says. ”I’ve even written a number of short horror films. I feel more confident, not only in writing, but in filming, directing, and editing.”\\nA digital approach to preserving culture.\\nIn Mexico, Apple has been working closely with educational institutions across the country to help set up and launch iOS Development Labs — bringing coding with the programming language Swift to students and preparing them for careers in Mexico’s iOS app economy. Among these institutions is the Wixárika School of Higher Secondary Education.\\nThe Wixáritari are the largest Indigenous community in Jalisco, Mexico. As the world around them continues to digitize, they have been forced to make tough decisions, including leaving their close-knit community in search of educational and economic opportunities in distant cities.\\nTo help ensure that the Wixáritari gain the professional skills they need while also preserving ties to their community, iOS Development Labs at the Universidad de Guadalajara (UdeG), along with regional partner Enactus, is helping them learn how to design, create, and code their own apps.\\n“We have so much talent around us all the time. Our mindset is always about creating opportunities for more and more people,” says Jesús Esparza, President of Enactus Mexico.\\nIn April 2023, six students and two teachers from the Wixárika School were invited to the lab at the Centro Universitario de Arte, Arquitectura y Diseño (CUAAD) campus of UdeG for coding training to support educational and economic opportunities in the Wixárika community.\\nThere, the students and teachers learned how to use iPad and Mac devices and gained foundational coding skills with Swift Playgrounds. After their training, they passed on their knowledge to others in their community.\\nRafael Cázares, Administrator for the UdeG iOS lab, is excited by the opportunities that coding has provided the students. “Now they want to solve all problems through apps,” he says. “They see a problem and know they can make a difference. It’s empowered them.”\\nTeaching tradition through tech.\\nThere are around 450,000 Cherokee Nation citizens in the world, but only about 2,000 are fluent Cherokee speakers — and most are over 70 years old.\\n“Our language is very ancient, but it holds the keys to the future and where we want to go,” says Deputy Principal Chief Bryan Warner of the Cherokee Nation. “If you get to that last fluent language speaker and that person passes, you can hear a way of life ending. That is something we do not want to see here.”\\nTo help keep the Cherokee language alive, the Cherokee Immersion Charter School opened in 2002. The Oklahoma school teaches math, music, and other subjects to kindergarten through eighth-grade students in their ancestral language. Though many students have parents and grandparents who were precluded from speaking Cherokee because of assimilation policies, at the Cherokee school, students speak their native language freely and proudly.\\n“Without this school, we wouldn’t learn the language. Without the language, our traditions could die out, our culture could die out. Without our language, we cannot really say we’re Cherokee,” says seventh-grader Kannon Lane.\\nTo support the school’s efforts, Apple donated iPad and Mac devices. And Apple’s Community Education Initiative team hosted an onsite training to help members of the school staff learn how to use iPad devices to make impactful learning content. The school is also expanding opportunities for its students through coding.\\n“Coding makes more possible,” says Deputy Chief Warner. “I imagine the day someone says to me, ‘Have you seen this new language app? It’s from a student who started out at our school. They developed it.’ There are tears that can be shed for many different reasons, but those tears would be joyful because I believe that our ancestors would be happy.”\\nCoding with community in mind.\\nThroughout his life, Jerome Warfield has held many roles. Pharmaceutical sales rep. Parole officer. Pastor. But at 57 years old, he never envisioned adding coder to that list — until he heard about Detroit’s Apple Developer Academy. That’s when Pastor Warfield, who was born and raised in Detroit, realized he could be a force for change within his community by learning to code.\\nHistorically the home of automotive engineering, Detroit now has a growing class of entrepreneurs who are pioneering a new future of digital innovation. The Developer Academy, which has more than 15 locations around the world, brought its program to downtown Detroit — its first-ever U.S. location — through a partnership with Michigan State University (MSU). The academy now reaches nearly 750 participants from the Detroit metropolitan area every year, with both short-term and long-term programs that teach the fundamentals of coding, design, project management, marketing, and iOS app development. With its wealth of minority-owned businesses, the Detroit area was an obvious choice for a new Developer Academy location. And for Pastor Warfield, attending the program was a transformative experience.\\n“At the Developer Academy, I was able to collaborate with people who came from completely different backgrounds than myself. They expanded my thinking and understanding of what’s possible,” says Pastor Warfield.\\nThe Developer Academy is also committed to helping public high school seniors continue their education by providing them with stipends to attend the academy. “This program changes the trajectory of individuals who now have access to technology,” says Pastor Warfield. “It opens up a whole new world for those of us who have felt shut out of the industry.”\\nThe success of the Developer Academy is evident in its students. Pastor Warfield plans to apply what he’s learned to help senior citizens and formerly incarcerated people. Other alumni have built healthcare and cryptocurrency apps. And still others have been hired as Developer Academy mentors. All of which shows how learning to code has the power to benefit both people and communities in significant ways.\\nA new state of the arts in the UK.\\nIn the United Kingdom, Apple’s partnership with the Southbank Centre is providing emerging Black creatives with the opportunity to showcase their talents at the country’s largest multi-arts center.\\n“It’s not about teaching creativity. It’s about empowering it,” says Alexandra Brierley, Director of Creative Learning at the Southbank Centre.\\nApple’s collaboration with the Southbank Centre began with a pilot project called Photo Fantastic. As part of the pilot, 15 emerging Black photographers from London produced over 4,000 photographs using Apple technology. Their work was featured at the Southbank Centre — and many of them won awards and recognition for their art.\\nThe Southbank Centre partnership has since expanded to include the Reframe project. Spanning London, Manchester, and Birmingham, Reframe provides 21 secondary schools with creative curricula to help spark a passion for creativity in the next generation. Reframe also includes an industry-led residency program that helps 80 Black artists develop their skills in photography, music, and filmmaking. Participants are given access to a suite of Apple technology to create their art, including iPhone, MacBook, and iMac devices, and are also mentored by Apple creative professionals. At the program’s culmination, they exhibit their work at the Southbank Centre, with their program peers, other creatives, and members of the press and public in attendance.\\n”If you don’t feel like you are part of a creative sector that reflects and represents your community, that has a huge impact on confidence,” says Brierley. “This program is an investment in the whole talent pipeline, from school to early career and beyond.”\\nAfter the program ends, support for the artists continues. This includes long-term mentorship and connection to a growing alumni network. Ultimately, these efforts make a positive impact not only on the artists but on the industry as a whole.\\nwithin reach.\\nHigher learning within reach.\\nDr. Amanda Quintero believes that access to education shouldn’t happen by chance. The daughter of immigrant parents, Dr. Quintero didn’t have access to higher education, and the expectation was that she’d find a job after finishing high school. It wasn’t until Dr. Quintero’s last semester of her senior year that a substitute teacher encouraged her to apply to university. That chance encounter changed Dr. Quintero’s entire trajectory. It was the moment she started to believe that she had what it took — that she belonged.\\nToday, Dr. Quintero dedicates her career to ensuring that other first-generation college students at Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) have the same opportunities she had. She serves as the Senior Advisor to the President for Inclusive Excellence and as the Equity Innovation Officer of the Global HSI Equity Innovation Hub at California State University, Northridge. Launched in partnership with Apple, the Global HSI Equity Innovation Hub is working to transform HSIs nationally to increase student success and equip Hispanic/Latinx and other minoritized and historically excluded students with skills to enter careers in science, technology, engineering, arts, and math (STEAM).\\n“It’s a full circle of giving back, investing in diverse talent with the very communities that many of the students come from to disrupt intergenerational inequity,” says Dr. Quintero.\\nIn addition to technology and grants, Apple is providing experts to help design educational spaces and programming, positioning learners for success in college and in the workforce. The goal is to move the needle on equipping a largely first-generation student population with the educational experiences and skills they need to become first-generation professionals in STEAM fields. The Global HSI Equity Innovation Hub is making this happen by connecting HSIs to resources, thought leaders, and one another, sharing what works to accelerate educational equity, all of which leads to a more inclusive and diverse workforce.\\nThe Global HSI Equity Innovation Hub signifies a shift in the paradigm from what students must do to be successful to what HSIs must do to serve students intentionally. It puts the onus on leadership to shine an equity lens on their structures, policies, and practices. It empowers students, faculty, and staff to transform institutions, which Dr. Quintero says is key to an effective equity-centered approach to education. The other key is engaging the families of first-generation college students, who are often disconnected from campus life. “The first time my family ever set foot on a college campus was the day of my graduation,” says Dr. Quintero. “And I don’t want that to be the experience of other students.”\\nInvesting in economic impact.\\nEmpowered companies lead to empowered communities.\\nSo we’re championing diverse suppliers and industry innovators.\\nFinancial advice that pays it forward.\\nFor too long, Beatriz Acevedo and Mary Hernandez heard stories from people in the Hispanic/Latinx communities about keeping their money under a mattress — or stashed away in a safe in their homes. They did this because the U.S. financial system has historically failed to understand and serve their needs. Acevedo and Hernandez knew they wanted to rectify this wrong by supporting their community in taking control of its finances.\\nSo along with Xavier Gutierrez, they founded SUMA Wealth. The Latina-led financial technology company, with Chief Operations Officer Hernandez, Chief Executive Officer Acevedo, and Chief Strategy and Business Development Officer Daniela Corrente, first focused on gaining their community’s trust.\\n“We want the Latino community to know, this company is built by people like you and for you,” says Hernandez.\\nCorrente adds: “Many institutions think because they put a sign in Spanish, they are going to attract people from the Latino community, but that’s not what inclusivity means.”\\nFor its part, SUMA Wealth is both an app and website that speaks directly to Hispanic/Latinx communities and their financial needs in culturally relevant and fun ways. A “dinero toolkit“ offers tips like how to pay off credit cards, while another section of the site provides answers to “401 qué“ questions.\\nThe startup receives support from Apple partner VamosVentures, which funds diverse entrepreneurs with groundbreaking ideas. Just over a year after launching, SUMA reaches more than five million users each month. And within three months of starting the program, these users go from no savings to an average of $500 in emergency savings.\\n“Ultimately, we want SUMA to be that all-in-one financial platform that fully supports our community at building generational wealth,” says Acevedo.\\nof community.\\nBold solutions born of community.\\nFor Maria Castellon, her business isn’t just about creating great products. It’s about prioritizing a safe environment for her employees to create these products. After immigrating to the United States from Mexico, Castellon witnessed hazardous conditions while working her way up through the manufacturing industry. So she dedicated herself to creating a better business model.\\nThat model turned into Bench-Tek Solutions, a Silicon Valley–based manufacturing company that creates sustainably designed workplace and laboratory furniture. As the company grew, Castellon, its CEO, worked to adopt more sustainable practices. To help achieve this, she applied to the Apple Impact Accelerator program. The 12-week virtual program is designed to help scale U.S.-based Black-, Hispanic/Latinx-, and Native/Indigenous-owned businesses innovating in Apple’s key environmental focus areas: renewable energy, carbon removal, recycling innovation, and smarter chemistry.\\n“The Accelerator was both a personal and professional opportunity for me to grow,” says Castellon. “The one-on-one mentorship was extremely impactful, and my mentor really inspired me to keep working on my goals.”\\nSince completing the program, Castellon and her team have reduced Bench-Tek’s carbon footprint and increased its long-term sustainability. As part of these efforts, they asked fellow Impact Accelerator alumnus and solar roofing company Simmitri, Inc., to install solar panels at Bench-Tek.\\n“We were interested in developing strategies and investing in technology like fiber-optic lasers and solar for increasing energy efficiency in our manufacturing. We also wanted to utilize these strategies for more energy-efficient, innovative furniture design,” she says.\\nBench-Tek’s success has elevated Hispanic/Latinx representation in Silicon Valley and the environmental sector. Castellon adds, “I love that a company such as Apple is really investing their resources and time and making an impact to create equality and inclusion for vendors like us who never had these chances before.”\\nApps made by everyone. For everyone.\\nFounders from underrepresented communities face unique challenges, especially when starting and leading technology companies.\\nApple Entrepreneur Camp was created to help support these founders and their organizations with app-driven businesses. The camp experience begins with an immersive technology lab, where participants receive one-on-one code-level guidance from Apple experts and engineers to help them significantly accelerate their apps. Along the way, they get mentorship, inspiration, and insights from top Apple leaders. They also get one year of free membership in the Apple Developer Program that includes access to beta software, advanced app capabilities, extensive beta-testing tools, and app analytics.\\nParticipants are developing more than just apps — they’re developing long-lasting relationships too. Entrepreneur Camp alumni become part of a growing community of world-class leaders working across tech, business, and social impact to support each other through the entrepreneurial journey. They also receive ongoing support from an Apple Developer representative, who is an expert on the developer ecosystem, as they build the next generation of cutting-edge apps.\\nCriminal justice rooted in reform.\\nWe’re standing up for what’s right by supporting organizations committed to transforming the criminal justice system.\\nChanging lives by changing systems.\\nCarly Stanley knew that things needed to change. The criminal legal system that systemically targeted Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples needed to change. The child protection services that separated babies, children, and young people from their culture and community needed to change. And Stanley, who had witnessed these injustices firsthand, believed she could fight for that change.\\n“It’s not a child protection system because the system doesn’t protect children. It’s not a criminal justice system because the system isn’t just,” says Stanley.\\nSo Stanley and her husband, Keenan Mundine, created the Australian, Aboriginal community–led nonprofit Deadly Connections, which started in Sydney as an outreach program for Aboriginal young people who were frequently targeted by police. “The vision of Deadly Connections is to address systemic racial disparities through advocacy and various initiatives and to continue to dismantle and disrupt the harmful systems that have caused and continue to cause a lot of pain for our community,” says Stanley.\\nHer outreach initially consisted of playing sports with the kids to help keep them engaged and connected. From there, Deadly Connections grew into an advocacy and support organization for adults and children affected by the child protection and criminal legal systems. “The prison experience is detrimental not only for the individual, but for the whole family and community. That’s why everything we do is grounded in culture and community. We know culture is a protective factor,” says Stanley.\\nDeadly Connections’ grassroots support includes logistical assistance for families such as ensuring that people can get to their appointments. And the nonprofit, supported by an Apple grant, helps kids and young people stay connected to their culture with one-on-one mentoring, group mentoring, and pop-up community events.\\nThe organization is also addressing systemic issues at the policy level, including supporting Raise the Age, a national campaign striving to stop Australia from locking up young children and sending them to prison. Currently children as young as 10 can be incarcerated in Australia, younger than the age set by most other countries. Stanley is advocating for all of these changes so that Aboriginal peoples don’t just survive, but thrive.\\nPainting new paths.\\nIn Louisiana, kids as young as 10 can be arrested, prosecuted, and incarcerated in the juvenile justice system. And 95 percent of these children are Black. They are exposed to the traumas of incarceration and denied the educational and development opportunities that every child deserves.\\nFor Journey Allen, this makes her work as the Director of Youth Education at Arts New Orleans for its Young Artist Movement (YAM) Diversion Program that much more important. It’s why she works tirelessly to be a source of healing and guidance for system-involved youth so they can find a path toward a brighter future.\\n“I really believe in the power of creativity and how it can care for and heal our young people,” says Allen.\\nYAM, cofounded by Judge Arthur Hunter Jr. in 2021, acts as an alternative to prosecution for children and youth with nonviolent offenses. Apple has partnered with Arts New Orleans, a nonprofit organization that supports arts and culture around the city, to take a stand against the incarceration of children by increasing support for the program. YAM is the only arts-based diversion program offered through the Orleans Parish District Attorney’s Office. After completion of the program, youths’ cases are dismissed.\\nAllen has witnessed firsthand how working with young people through the arts gives them a second chance, as well as a sense of hope and possibility. “A lot of the kids that come through the diversion program have a true desire to do well,” she says. “They’re just still searching for that thing that will capture their attention.”\\nOne such outlet is mural painting, which has quickly become one of the youths’ favorite forms of creative expression. Local businesses, nonprofit organizations, and city agencies commission these projects, and the kids gain real-world experience working with clients. They use iPad devices to film the mural-making process and have even used digital animation software on iPad to project their mural designs onto city buildings.\\nIn addition to broadening their capabilities as artists, YAM helps its participants leverage art to speak to the issues directly affecting their communities. “The YAM program encouraged us to help people and shed light on different topics,” says Aliyah Pflueger, a YAM student artist who applied to the program as a way to help develop her creative abilities. “We have a voice through this program to say something. People want to hear what kids have to say and what’s going on around them. We’re telling our story and helping our community.”\\nFunding the front lines of change.\\nBlack, Hispanic/Latinx, and Indigenous communities continue to be disproportionately harmed by disparities in the criminal justice system. Black Americans are incarcerated in state prisons at nearly five times the rate of white Americans. Latin Americans are incarcerated at 1.3 times the rate of white Americans, and Native Americans are incarcerated at a rate 38 percent higher than the national average — the highest rate of any demographic. That’s why Apple continues to support and donate to organizations dedicating their time, talents, and resources to fight for systems that serve everyone equally.\\nOur grant projects in Australia support Indigenous-owned and ‑operated efforts such as the Art Gallery of New South Wales (NSW) Djamu Youth Justice Program, which supports Indigenous young people impacted by the justice system through art and culture. Programming includes creative workshops, artistic projects, and discussions with local artists.\\nApple is also donating to domestic groups whose work is laying the foundation for meaningful reform within the United States. Our grant recipients include the following groups:\\nThe Anti-Recidivism Coalition (ARC) works to end mass incarceration in California by empowering formerly and currently incarcerated people through a support network, comprehensive reentry services — including transitional housing, clinical therapy, case management, and workforce development — and grassroots policy advocacy to create a more just and equitable criminal justice system for all people.\\n-\\nTurn2U Inc.’s The Last Mile program (TLM) offers opportunities for personal and professional growth for justice-impacted individuals, both in-system and post-release, through education and technology training.\\n-\\nRecidiviz is a tech nonprofit that partners with criminal justice agencies to advance their use of data to safely and equitably reduce incarceration at scale.\\n-\\nThe Vera Institute of Justice brings researchers, organizers, and government leaders together to create evidence-based solutions that restore communities and end mass incarceration.\\n-\\nDefy Ventures helps currently and formerly incarcerated people across the country find success in reentry through employment and entrepreneurship.\\n-\\nApple is grateful to all of the trailblazing organizations we’re partnering with for their tireless dedication to equity as we work toward a better future together.\\nMore from Apple on REJI.\\nOur values lead the way.\\nInclusion and Diversity\\nWe’re holding ourselves accountable for creating a culture where everyone belongs.\\n-\\nEducation\\nWe empower students and educators to learn, create, and define their own success.\\n-\\nSupply Chain\\nWe prioritize providing safe, respectful, and supportive workplaces for everyone.\\n-\\nEnvironment\\nWe’re committed to bringing our net emissions to zero across our entire carbon footprint by 2030.\\n-\\nAccessibility\\nOur built-in accessibility features are designed to work the way you do.\\n-\\nPrivacy\\nWe design every product and service to keep your data safe and secure.\\n-', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

If you set a delivery window, and make sure you’re home to receive it, that teenage kid with your expensive order may never show with the items. Never again.. The most advanced company still finds ways to penny pinch and ruin their customers experience before even getting the product.\\nEdit: Apparently Uber drivers stealing packages is common now, and according to some stories, Apple may or may not believe you and reimburse you. Always pick up in the store!\\nDISAPPOINTED\\nMy son had bought a brand new phone from working at the library. It was an iPhone XR. A year later right after the warranty expired his Face ID feature didn’t work anymore. We called customer service and we were put on hold and were talking to many different people for hours trying to figure out the issue until the Apple “Senior Advisor” called it a hardware malfunction. She said that it won’t get fixed and that we would have to pay $399 dollars for a replacement. Is this some kind of joke. Or even better a pyramid scheme that as soon as the warranty runs out let’s destroy an innocent kids phone so that the kids parents will buy him the new phone. DON’T EVER BUT FROM APPLE!! It’s nothing but a scam. I was disappointed especially because this wasn’t my first Apple product but my sons first Apple product.\\nApple account balance is useless\\nUnprofessional Apple staff and DO NOT deposit your Apple gift card balance into your Apple account.\\nI was told I could use my Apple account balance to pay for my iPhone repair, but when it was done the second day, I was told I couldn't pay from my Apple account balance. However, I could have paid for the repair if I hadn't deposited my Apple gift card balance into my account. And eventually, I paid by my own credit card and left the Apple account balance unused.\\nIn short, once you deposit your gift card into your Apple account balance, it will have very limited usage. You can't use it combined with installment, can't use it for repair. That's just from what I know. Come on, it is already 2022, how can Apple hasn't fixed it?

that they’re on your radar in the Find My app where you can also track down your Apple devices and keep up with friends and family Buy AirTag Misplacing something like your wallet doesn’t have to be a big deal when it has AirTag attached You can play a sound on the built in speaker by going to the new Items tab in the Find My app Or just say “Hey Siri find my wallet” If it’s hiding nearby — like under the couch or in the next room — just follow the sound and your search is over If your AirTag is nearby your iPhone can lead you straight to it with Precision Finding1 – which shows you the exact distance and direction to head in – thanks to built‑in Ultra Wideband technology When youʼve left something far behind like at the beach or the gym the Find My network — hundreds of millions of iPhone iPad and Mac devices around the world — helps track down your AirTag And itʼs designed to protect your privacy every step of the way Your AirTag sends out a secure Bluetooth signal that can be detected by nearby devices in the Find My network These devices send the location of your AirTag to iCloud — then you can go to the Find My app and see it on a map The whole process is anonymous and encrypted to protect your privacy And itʼs efficient so thereʼs no need to worry about battery life or data usage Just like your other Apple devices AirTag can be put into Lost Mode Then when it’s detected by a device in the network you’ll automatically get a notification You can also set it so someone can get your contact info by tapping your AirTag with their NFC capable smartphone — that’s the same technology that lets people pay for things with their phones Only you can see where your AirTag is Your location data and history are never stored on the AirTag itself Devices that relay the location of your AirTag also stay anonymous and that location data is encrypted every step of the way So not even Apple knows the location of your AirTag or the identity of the device that helps find it AirTag is designed to discourage unwanted tracking If someone else’s AirTag finds its way into your stuff the network will notice it’s traveling with you and send your iPhone an alert If you still havenʼt found it after awhile the AirTag will start playing a sound letting you know it’s there Of course if you happen to be with a friend who has an AirTag or on a train with a whole bunch of people with AirTag don’t worry These alerts only get triggered when an AirTag is separated from its owner A one‑tap setup instantly connects your AirTag with your iPhone or iPad Enter a name for your AirTag

Environmental rights are human rights The global impacts of climate change are becoming more apparent by the day Our approach to protecting the planet considers not only the environmental implications of every decision we make but also the impact of those decisions on people particularly those living and working in communities disproportionately affected by climate change That’s why we consider our supply chain in the context of the local communities where our suppliers operate Low income and historically marginalized communities too often bear the brunt of the effects of climate change As part of our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative REJI we created the Impact Accelerator for Black Latinx and Indigenous owned businesses focused on environmental solutions The Impact Accelerator is just

A zero waste mindset iPhone assembly China mainland iPhone assembly China mainland A zero waste mindset We’re dedicated to minimizing our resource use and waste as we build our products We require our suppliers to avoid sending waste to landfills by implementing recycling and reuse programs and developing innovative materials and recycling strategies Today all established final assembly sites for major Apple products are Zero Waste Certified Water is a critical resource shared by people and ecosystems around the world and we’re working to protect it for future generations Through our Clean Water Program we’re helping suppliers reduce their water usage promote water recycling and prevent water pollution Since the launch of this program in 2015 20 of our suppliers’ facilities have achieved certification through the Alliance for Water Stewardship AWS the world’s leading water stewardship organization Earning this certification requires suppliers to adopt industry leading water conservation and stewardship practices while also engaging with their community to protect resources across their local water basin From top to bottom Apple Watch band manufacturing Japan HomePod

journey to 100% recycled and renewable Materials recovered by Daisy Apple’s iPhone disassembly robot United States Materials recovered by Daisy Apple’s iPhone disassembly robot United States Our journey to 100% recycled and renewable Our goal is to one day build our products using only recycled and renewable materials and eliminate our reliance on mining Each year we move closer to that goal with more components being made with 100 percent recycled or renewable materials Effectively disassembling and recycling our products after their use is also a key part of our work to support a circular economy These processes help recover valuable materials that can be used again making the best use of limited resources and enabling us to design and build the next generation of devices to be even better for people and the planet That’s why we help our suppliers efficiently and safely recycle our products by providing Recycler Guides and conducting assessments to verify that they’re meeting our standards We maintain strict standards for the responsible sourcing of materials — whether primary or recycled Since Apple doesn’t directly purchase or procure primary materials we work closely with our suppliers to uphold these standards and work with partners to improve conditions in and around mining communities Clockwise from top Daisy Apple’s iPhone disassembly robot United

accountable at every level Because belonging takes all of us We’re continuing to create a culture of inclusion increasing representation across teams and holding ourselves accountable at every level Because belonging takes all of us For many team members and customers in the deaf and hard of hearing community sign language interpretation is critical — but having an interpreter on hand isn’t always an option So a diverse group of people across multiple teams at Apple came together to provide access to interpretation on short notice “We felt strongly that we needed to solve the question ‘How can we facilitate communication with our deaf and hard of hearing colleagues and customers in the way that works best for them’” Traditional in person sign language interpretation services require booking in advance and are challenging to scale especially in the context of customer service and internal teams So this cross functional group collaborated to create an experience that would be a viable and immediate alternative for Apple customers and employees alike “We considered not just what would be adequate support but what would really deliver an experience that recognizes and embraces people’s differences and cultures” says Antony Kennedy People Accessibility The result of these efforts is SignTime SignTime helps people communicate with AppleCare and Retail Customer Care in their web browsers using American Sign Language ASL in the United States and Canada British Sign Language BSL in the United Kingdom and French Sign Language LSF in France In 2023 the service launched in Australia Japan where it is known as HandTime Germany where it is known as SignChat Spain Italy and Korea In addition to in person interpreters customers visiting Apple Store locations can use SignTime to access a sign language interpreter remotely without booking ahead of time “At Apple we provide tools for our team to do their best work Equitable access to language is especially powerful within the deaf community and SignTime is a step forward in that direction” says Gus Shitama Global Accessibility Policy and Initiatives SignTime has already made a difference in how the team connects — both with each other and with customers “After SignTime was released I felt a stronger sense of belonging because it bridged the communication gap that previously existed” says Ricky Winarta Apple Carnegie Library “This made it easier to build relationships removed any unnecessary barriers when typing back and forth with customers and coworkers and made the customer’s experience better” Since our earliest days inclusivity has been fundamental to our design process “Inclusion is not something you can tack on at the end or do once at the beginning and you’re done it’s an ongoing effort to constantly improve the experience that everyone has and it’s done to make people’s lives better” We consider inclusivity at every step — and this work requires close collaboration among a wide range of teams One such effort involved Face ID where cross functional teams came together\n",

      "to ensure that our machine learning model had extensive diverse data This meant taking into account a huge range of facial feature variations and coverings in order to build something that works for people with light or dark skin for people of every age for all kinds of facial shapes and for people who are fully sighted blind or have low vision Our focus on inclusive design remains a priority — and we’re working to be even more inclusive Jerremy Holland Joshua Cohen of Apple University and Denise Hui of AIML created the Inclusive Products Initiative – an internal knowledge sharing website and network for anyone at Apple interested in inclusive product design As part of this initiative the Inclusion & Diversity team developed a workflow that lets product design teams connect with Diversity Network Associations DNAs to review their work In addition Apple University created Technology for All of Us an inclusivity course that uses case studies from inside and outside Apple to examine how to weigh the right considerations — including potential trade offs — and ultimately make informed choices The course description aptly sums it up “Technology for All of Us encourages you to consider what it means to build for humanity in all its variety — and why it matters” “Our role is not to do the work for people or to tell people what to do or to look under the hood before something goes out the door” says Cohen “Our job is to empower people who have the responsibility to develop inclusive products That is the way to create something sustainable” Together these efforts help inspire a culture where being inclusive by design becomes an inherent part of everyone’s process Our comprehensive benefits are designed to help every Apple employee and their family feel healthy supported and secure For Veterans navigating the transition from service to the civilian or corporate world can be tricky Veterans@Apple and the Benefits and Wellness teams collaborated and spent time listening to the needs of the community — to ensure that every Veteran at Apple understands the full range of health financial and wellness benefits available to them including tailored benefits such as military time away “We created an approach to help our National Guard Reservists and Veterans better understand the range of benefits so that they can make the best decisions for their unique situations” “There are a lot of questions out there — even more for our Guards and Reservists who live in both worlds — that we can’t afford to overlook” Rooze says Mike Burtnick Veterans@Apple and AppleCare At Home Advisor says that raising awareness helps start important conversations and encourages Veterans to get the help they need “Just letting people know what we offer helps bring about dialogue It shows that it’s OK to seek help it’s OK to talk to others about issues you may be dealing with” Ultimately the goal for Veterans@Apple and the Benefits and Wellness teams is to ensure that Veterans feel comfortable seeking the care they need while bringing this community even closer together Meaningful progress requires more than just celebration Which is why we’re inspired by culturally significant moments — like International Women’s Day and Pride Month — to move important conversations about inclusion forward “Stories have everything to do with building civilizations They allow people to say I am here I am present I have been here” The teams behind Apple Music Apple Fitness Apple News Apple Health Apple Global Events and more collaborate to build campaigns that bring Apple employees together For International Women’s Day these teams invited women and nonbinary creators from inside and outside Apple to share their work Occasions like these give us the opportunity to rally around important causes and make a positive impact They also create the opportunity to express shared values and be part of something bigger together For Pride Month LGBTQ+ employees from Apple Retail Engineering and Finance all shared their personal experiences Their stories were featured in a 2022 Pride film Steve Jobs Theater Presents iBelong Telling these stories in an intersectional way — across race gender sexual orientation and cultures — is key “We can’t be whole unless we tell our stories in a complex and complete way” Etwaroo says Diversity Network Association DNA chapters Our world class talent in Miami is dedicated to serving Latin American and US Hispanic customers and communities They’re also key in making sure we consider diverse perspectives in everything we do “Diverse representation is core to how we think as a company And having more Latinos in our workforce and leadership is key” Addressing the needs of these communities and providing meaningful access to technology — and to the opportunities that technology provides — requires deep collaboration “We are passionate in making this initiative an important pillar inside of Apple across everything we do” says Alberto Escobedo Marketing ALAC Apple Latin America and Caribbean Canada and US Hispanic “We found that bringing together a wide group of leaders from various areas of the organization makes a huge difference It sparks inspiration and creativity and motivates our teams The impact of the work has been truly rewarding” The teams in Miami and Latin America also rolled out local Diversity Network Associations DNAs — including Black@Apple Pride@Apple and Women@Apple — as a way to enable connections encourage conversation on topics that matter and provide access to helpful resources All three chapters have continued to grow month after month with overall membership increasing by 138 percent by the end\n",

      "of 2022 “I’m especially proud of our team’s drive engagement and participation in these newly formed communities” says Laura Veronica Gonzalez People Latin America Corporate “The work passion and energy of our team to continue to build our culture of belonging is inspiring This is truly representative of how we cultivate innovation at Apple” Our New Silicon Initiative NSI is working with Historically Black Colleges and Universities HBCUs to help inspire prepare and create opportunities for more Black students to enter careers in hardware technology — a critical and fast growing field NSI began in 2018 as an ongoing partnership between Apple and educational institutions In 2021 it expanded to include four HBCUs Alabama A&M Prairie View A&M Morgan State and Howard University Each school has received Apple Innovation Grants and curricula building support from Apple experts “With our HBCU partners NSI is directly creating a pathway to a more diverse engineering workforce” Apple provides hands on learning exercises and course programming and Apple engineers volunteer their time as guest lecturers Students also receive one on one mentoring with the Apple volunteers “We know this will take time but we’re energized by the strong interest from students the collaboration with faculty and the potential impact of the opportunities ahead of us” Zerbe says AppleCare is known for its unparalleled customer service And as one of the most diverse teams within Apple it’s on a mission to champion equity and drive inclusion even deeper within its organization “The best way to serve our customers is to create even more ways to support our people” Apple has a long standing commitment to I&D and in 2020 Farhoudi started the Inclusion & Equity at AppleCare IEAC program to challenge his team to create an even more inclusive environment The team delivered launching a dozen pilots and programs One of the first programs was the Speaker Series which provides a platform for AppleCare employees to have open and honest discussions about topics ranging from racism and sexism to allyship in action The program creates a safe space for employees to show up as their authentic selves and helps create a stronger sense of belonging Farhoudi was one of its first speakers “To foster an empathetic and compassionate environment for our team I try to lead with vulnerability and openness It’s not always easy but nothing that’s worth doing is” he says “So many people have felt less alone” says Kyla Cragg IEAC “At Apple we believe that our differences make us stronger and the Speaker Series is a great example It has helped people learn from those that are different from them and also learn that we have much more in common than we realize” Another IEAC program Partnerships serves to improve representation at all levels of the AppleCare team Through regular live sessions employees from underrepresented communities URCs connect with hiring managers to gain better visibility into opportunities and hone the essential skills and qualifications needed for open roles “This program demystifies the roles and gives people a forum to ask questions to help them gain confidence to apply” adds Cragg Sessions are promoted to Apple’s Diversity Network Associations DNAs and Black in AppleCare and AppleCare Latinidad to further connect communities and foster a sense of belonging within AppleCare The Partnerships program gives visibility to these opportunities and has led to applications from a more diverse set of candidates Representation within AppleCare Support Hardware technology is at the heart of innovation at Apple And a big part of innovation involves including different perspectives So the people building Mac iPhone and other products are working to build even more diverse teams In 2018 Apple in Israel started working with ASAL Technologies in the Palestinian Authority PA Through that partnership five engineers were initially recruited to work at the Rawabi R&D center Now there are more than 80 engineers — and that number is growing “This work benefits not just the employees themselves but the community and economy as a whole” For locals like Deema Omar of Hardware Technologies Israel these efforts are opening doors and breaking barriers “As an Arab this is a strong statement from Apple to bring people together I’m very happy and proud to hear that Apple is investing in this initiative I speak about it as a great representation of Apple’s investment in inclusion and diversity” Blechman says “This makes people of all backgrounds feel proud to work for an organization that stands for its values Apple as an organization has decided to be intentionally inclusive and this work demonstrates that” For years Apple employees all over the world have found community through our Diversity Network Associations DNAs These member led groups are designed to inspire a culture of belonging that helps their colleagues feel supported connected and empowered — while also encouraging the kind of open dialogue that helps lead to stronger allyship across Apple “When we’ve spoken to people about the culture of Apple and what really stands out to them it’s inclusion People really feel they can be themselves here” One way DNAs make this happen is through a partnership with the Apple Recruiting team The team hosts résumé and interview skill building workshops for DNA members and when possible informs DNAs of open roles This collaboration also led to a page on the Careers at Apple website where DNA members share their stories with people looking for both a career and community at Apple “One person had a story about volunteering with Afghan refugees through her DNA — how it\n",
      "\n",
      "really resonated with her because she has an Afghan background Another told a story about feeling accepted at Apple” says Molla “People sharing their stories then learning about how those stories connect with people is really powerful” Brian Rekasis of Global Recruiting Marketing has also seen the benefits of the website “Our Careers at Apple site is one of the first ways candidates get a sense of Apple’s culture and values and our DNAs are a huge part of that” he says “It’s about being seen and heard which leads to feeling valued” In 2021 Apple launched Today at Apple Creative Studios in Los Angeles Beijing Bangkok London Washington DC and Chicago Since then the program has expanded to even more places around the world “Today at Apple champions the spirit of creativity for all and what makes creativity amazing is its ability to embrace the different the new and what is to come” The five week Creative Studios program connects Retail teams with community organizations to offer learning opportunities for local groups — many of which include people from underrepresented communities In Taipei Today at Apple partnered with Taiwan Tongzhi Hotline Association an LGBTQ+ nonprofit and Pride@Apple to create a safe space for LGBTQ+ kids and teens to express and shape their own perspective of their creative selves Through the course a group of young creatives in the LGBTQ+ community learned how to make digital avatars AR filters and photo portraitures In Beijing Today at Apple Creative Studios is now in its second year This team has continued to partner with the China Foundation for Rural Development to teach photography and videography to kids and teens from migrant families “Belonging means the opportunity to realize your dreams” says Jing Yang Today at Apple Beijing “For some people a dream is just a dream We try to make them possible” This is just the start A new program will be launching in 2023 in Beijing to keep youth connected to their creative passions “I am touched by the talent of this group of youth” says Yang “By the end of the program people totally change At the beginning they have very low voices but at the end people go onto the stage and share their projects It’s a huge change” Even after they’ve completed the program these creatives will continue to be supported through mentorship résumé workshops and leadership training to further help them realize their dreams We work to ensure that our stores reflect the communities we serve That’s why we’re increasing leadership representation across our Retail teams The number of women globally and Black and Hispanic/Latinx leaders in the United States in Retail grew by two percentage points year over year And since 2017 these communities grew by five or more percentage points each One example of how we increased female representation globally is in Japan We worked closely with women across our Japan teams to better understand what they need to succeed in leadership — then we developed an Inclusion & Diversity action plan to accelerate how we recruit and promote more women in Retail As a result of these efforts female representation in Japan Retail leadership increased from 12 percent in September 2017 to 30 percent as of December 2022 “Diversity inspires more diversity It’s all about visibility and showing what’s possible in order to inspire” Having more women in leadership roles is one part of creating a representative team Patrick Schuerpf of Retail North and South East Asia enlisted the help of our Inclusion & Diversity team to host unconscious bias workshops for Retail leadership Together these efforts empower each of us to help everyone succeed Female representation in Japan Retail leadership Our workforce is more diverse than ever And there is more work to do We launched Apple’s Racial Equity and Justice Initiative REJI to address systemic racism and expand opportunities for communities of color in three key areas education economic empowerment and criminal justice reform “We’re committed to continuing to develop and strengthen strategies aimed at addressing racial inequity and injustice in the US” One way we’ve expanded opportunities is by bringing the Apple Developer Academy to downtown Detroit — its first US location — through a partnership with Michigan State University MSU The academy reaches nearly 750 participants from the Detroit metropolitan area every year with both short term and long term programs that teach the fundamentals of coding design project management marketing and iOS app development The Developer Academy is also committed to helping public high school seniors continue their education by providing them with stipends to attend the academy REJI has since expanded its work beyond the United States including initiatives in New Zealand the United Kingdom Australia and Mexico “While our efforts in the US remain a priority we must also support solutions that combat systemic issues for Black and Brown people and communities around the globe” says Johnson In Australia REJI has funded initiatives and community nonprofits serving Indigenous communities One example is First Australians Capital a national Indigenous led organization that gives Indigenous businesses the financial knowledge and capital support needed to thrive Another is Original Power an Indigenous led organization that has launched community led renewable energy projects in the Northern Territory and beyond to help provide Indigenous communities with lower cost clean energy And in the United Kingdom a partnership with the Southbank Centre — the UK’s largest multi arts center — supports emerging Black talent The partnership program Reframe provides 80 creatives from London Manchester and Birmingham

      "opportunity and resources to showcase their work and positions them for long lasting careers in the arts “Through partnerships we’re using our platform to amplify the work of local organizations and communities globally and help drive meaningful change” says Johnson In Mexico Apple has been working closely with universities across the country to help set up and launch iOS Development Labs — bringing coding with Apple’s programming language Swift to students and preparing them for careers in Mexico’s thriving iOS app economy With 12 iOS Development Labs across the country these students get hands on experience to learn Swift — ultimately creating designing and coding their own apps to make a difference in their communities Pay equity is embedded in Apple’s approach to compensation Since 2017 Apple has achieved and maintained gender pay equity In the United States we have also achieved pay equity with respect to race and ethnicity — as well as pay equity at the intersections of race ethnicity and gender We don’t ask for previous salary information during the interview process For new team members we look at internal and external salary data and how closely a person’s skills experiences and qualifications match the job requirements to determine pay And every year we partner with an independent third party expert to examine each team member’s total compensation and make adjustments where necessary to ensure that we maintain pay equity Apple TV+ is committed to creating stories that reflect everyone It’s important that our audiences can relate deeply to the characters and their lives To achieve that there must be representation — both behind and in front of the camera From stories like the Oscar winning CODA the multilingual drama Pachinko and the heartwarming Cha Cha Real Smooth to real and dramatized experiences like those in Killers of the Flower Moon and Little America inclusivity is at the core of our content As part of our efforts we collaborate with creators from around the world including women’s rights activist and youngest Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai seven time Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton and award winning storytellers Alfonso Cuarón Maya Rudolph and Natalie Portman We do this because we firmly believe that Apple TV+ is a destination to explore the full spectrum of the human experience And because we believe in the power of entertainment to bring us closer together while also helping us gain a better understanding of each other ourselves and the world around us Performance reviews involve more than results — they look at how people perform their jobs They encompass how people work with — and show up for — each other One initiative aimed at creating a more equitable employee experience is to have inclusion and diversity considered as part of every performance review for every person at every level While aspects of this work are far from new it’s been expanded to acknowledge how team members encourage others to share their points of view include diverse perspectives in pursuit of the best approaches or ideas and contribute to a more inclusive environment “Every day team members across the company are doing their part to build a more inclusive Apple We’re further reinforcing our values by recognizing those that do this well — and holding everyone accountable for inclusion and diversity” With close support and involvement from the executive team Inclusion & Diversity Talent Management Employee and Corporate Communications People Business Partners and Apple University worked meticulously to ensure that the expectations are clear and that they’re applied globally Our work to make Apple more inclusive extends to the businesses we work with The Supplier Diversity Program partners with nearly every team within Apple and is dedicated to working with suppliers from historically underrepresented communities to create a more equitable world In the United States we categorize diverse suppliers as Black Hispanic/Latinx Asian Indian Asian Pacific Indigenous Women Disabled LBGTQ+ and Veteran owned “By working to address diversity equity and inclusion within our global supply chain we’re helping to drive economic empowerment in new ways” In October 2021 Apple was acknowledged as Corporation of the Year by the US based National Minority Supplier Development Council NMSDC This distinction is NMSDC’s highest honor for companies that make it a priority to partner with ethnic minority–owned suppliers specifically those with Black Hispanic/Latinx Asian Indian Asian Pacific and Indigenous owners “Our suppliers are not only giving back to their employees but also to their community” says Seto Many of these supplier companies also have diverse teams and boards of directors And while there is more work to do Scott Vowels of Supplier Diversity says “it’s heartening to see the incredible impact of our suppliers and vendors” That’s why the Supplier Diversity team at Apple is focused on ensuring that opportunities for underrepresented groups are considered in every supply chain decision Not only can we create greater equity but we can help foster greater economic opportunities for everyone Over the past year we filled more open leadership roles than ever with women globally and Black candidates in the United States We remain committed to continuing to grow leadership representation We’re addressing systemic racism by expanding opportunities for communities of color globally We prioritize providing safe respectful supportive workplaces for everyone We empower students and educators to learn create and define their own success Our built in accessibility features are designed to work the way you

Legal Team on Nov 20 2009 Greater access to education gives everyone more ways to realize their potential That’s why Apple is committed to providing people around the world with more opportunities to learn through partnerships in over 100 countries and regions Education moves learners leaders innovators communities and everyone forward Northridge California Higher learning within reach For most of Amanda Quintero’s childhood going to college wasn’t an option As the daughter of immigrant parents who weren’t familiar with higher education the expectation was that she’d find a job once she finished high school It wasn’t until the last semester of her senior year that a substitute teacher first encouraged her to apply to a university That chance encounter changed her entire trajectory It was the moment she began to believe she had what it took — that she belonged Today Dr Quintero dedicates her career to ensuring that other first generation college students have the same opportunities she had A leading content expert on Hispanic Serving Institutions HSIs and recognized student success innovator Dr Quintero currently serves as the Senior Advisor to the President for Inclusive Excellence and as the Equity Innovation Officer of the Global HSI Equity Innovation Hub at California State University Northridge The Global HSI Equity Innovation Hub launched in partnership with Apple will make a significant impact on first generation college students throughout the nation connecting diverse talent to opportunity With Dr Quintero’s visionary leadership this initiative will work to transform HSIs nationally to increase student success and equip Latinx and other minoritized and historically excluded students with skills for careers in STEAM “This partnership with Apple is going to help us be bold and innovative about blurring the lines between the physical space which is the hub and the virtual space” says Dr Quintero In addition to the technology and grants Apple is providing experts to help design the space and the programming which will be essential to position learners for success in college and in the workforce The goal is to move the needle on equipping a largely first generation student population with the educational experiences and skills they will need to become first generation professionals in STEAM fields The Global HSI Equity Innovation Hub will do this by connecting HSIs to resources\n",

      "thought leaders and one another sharing what works to accelerate educational equity and leading to a more inclusive and diverse future workforce “Diverse talent is an asset that benefits us all” says Dr Quintero “It’s a full circle of giving back investing their talent with the very communities that many of the students come from to disrupt intergenerational inequity” “The first time my family ever stepped foot on a college campus was the day of my graduation” Dr Quintero says “and I don’t want that to be the experience of other students” The Global HSI Equity Innovation Hub signifies a shift in the paradigm from what students must do to be successful to what HSIs must do to serve students intentionally It puts the onus on leadership to shine an equity lens on their structures policies and practices It empowers students faculty and staff to transform institutions which Dr Quintero says is key to an effective equity centered approach to education The other imperative of the programming is to engage the families of first generation college students who are often disconnected from campus life “The first time my family ever stepped foot on a college campus was the day of my graduation” she says “and I don’t want that to be the experience of other students” Whole family programming and outreach to students and their families will ensure that access to higher education and the completion of a degree doesn’t happen by chance Cork Ireland A culture of creativity and innovation Hollyhill a suburb of Cork City in Ireland is home to Apple’s European headquarters It’s also the home of Terence MacSwiney Community College a Cork Education and Training Board School serving students from ages 12 through 18 In 2015 the school’s leadership entered into a partnership with Apple As part of this collaboration Apple volunteers began working alongside teachers at the school to help implement the Everyone Can Code and Everyone Can Create curricula aimed at increasing student engagement through coding and creativity Additionally Apple provided the necessary funding and technology so the students could have hands on learning experiences The partnership was a positive spark for the community The students at Terence MacSwiney were now being exposed to the latest in technology and creativity And from working with Apple volunteers they started learning about careers that many of them didn’t know existed “These very interesting people came into our school and opened the students’ minds to possibilities and dreams for themselves” says Eva Corbett a postprimary teacher at Terence MacSwiney Community College “A lot of the kids don’t think they’re creative until they come to the Everyone Can Create class” Corbett says “But they start drawing on their iPad and end up discovering a new world of innovation” Corbett who teaches Apple curriculum based courses has witnessed the impact of the partnership firsthand and has numerous anecdotes of student success One of these stories comes from an Everyone Can Code class where students developed an app prototype called Food Fund “The app was designed to assist with the management of a social action project also created by students to reduce food waste in local schools redistribute food to a local charity called Penny Dinners and raise awareness of food needs in our community” says Corbett Another story that Corbett shares is about a group of girls who wrote an original song called “Live Out Loud” in an Everyone Can Create class The anthem they composed was so powerful that it was selected to be part of a government led national campaign to celebrate LGBTI+ young people The group is now using GarageBand and iMovie to produce their own music and videos “In terms of how it will impact their future it’ll give them confidence to try new things” says Corbett Ultimately Corbett says the partnership with Apple has brought a culture of creativity and innovation to Terence MacSwiney Community College “A lot of the kids don’t think they’re creative until they come to the Everyone Can Create class” she says “But they start drawing on their iPad and end up discovering a new world of innovation” Boise Idaho Languages lead the way For many immigrants and refugees in America joining a new community can be an overwhelming experience Language barriers often become an enduring challenge especially when seeking job opportunities or continuing their education In Idaho the Onramp initiative’s goal is to build the state’s workforce by developing Idaho educators and expanding opportunities for students This statewide program is a unique partnership between Apple Boise State University the Idaho Digital Learning Alliance and the College of Western Idaho CWI For CWI instructors like Sarah Strickley helping immigrants and refugees develop more English communication skills enables them to feel closer to their communities and empowers them to make a difference “For equity to happen we need to educate leaders that look like the world” Strickley says CWI’s English language learner ELL and English as a second language program offers free English and digital skills classes to non native English speakers With support from Apple’s Community Education Initiative team this program incorporates the Everyone Can Create curriculum an introduction to Develop in Swift and devices to support digital skills acquisition Strickley has been teaching ELL for over 10 years and she designed a course within the program that teaches English through code and vice versa She works with more than 150 students across 30 countries of origin with more than 31 languages spoken Students have varying educational levels and experience with technology Some have\n",

      "never interacted with an iPad before while some have advanced credentials from their home country What they have in common is a communication barrier that limits potential job opportunities Strickley says “The goal is a sustainable program that every student is able to touch no matter where they are on their educational journey” Her approach to teaching both language and code reinforces the unique strengths and skills within every student Strickley says “When you braid creativity community and coding that’s where the magic happens because technology stands up and fills in those language or learning gaps for students” Strickley believes that creativity plays a major role in bringing people closer to their community She incorporates Challenge Based Learning — an approach to leveraging technology to solve real world problems — which often becomes the first interaction and connection for many of these students to their communities They’re actively learning to make connections and creatively solve problems while simultaneously building self confidence and valuable social capital Immigrants and refugees often arrive in Idaho without a network or support system and Strickley’s efforts with CWI ultimately empower them to find their own voice and build their place in a community they now call home Strickley says “Every one of us is a bundle of knowledge regardless of our language accent background or circumstance And education helps us share that knowledge with each other toward more understanding” For Strickley technology is an equalizer that helps everyone get on the same page With devices in hand and newfound technological knowledge every community member has the potential to find or even create their own success Johannesburg South Africa Code that reaches new zip codes Katleho Letshae lives in Johannesburg South Africa When a friend told him about the Apple Coding course being offered at Wilberforce Community College he jumped at the opportunity “It’s rare to find courses like this in developing countries” Letshae says The course was made possible by HBCU C2 an initiative by Tennessee State University in partnership with Apple to empower Historically Black Colleges and Universities HBCUs to bring coding and creativity opportunities to their home campuses and surrounding communities HBCU C2 promotes innovation and education equity and it aims to address community challenges using app design and Apple’s Swift programming language Apple helped launch the program and is involved at various levels from providing the grants and technology needed to scale the initiative to designing the curriculum and course content Additionally the Apple team has helped prepare instructors to teach the classes using the Apple Teacher Training curriculum To date the program has spread to 46 HBCUs all of which have committed to serving as a Center of Innovation in their communities Part of this commitment includes establishing an “Innovation Team” to implement the program locally devising at least two courses each academic year with C2 strategies and offering out of school coding and creativity learning experiences for all age groups including K–12 after school and local community organizations This shared commitment has been instrumental in creating opportunities that are diversifying the tech and creative workforce and bridging the digital divide among underrepresented minority groups HBCU C2 has been so successful that it has recently expanded beyond the United States to three schools in Africa serving students in high school and in two year and four year colleges That includes Wilberforce Community College where 88 students have gone through the program in the first year One of those students was Letshae In the course he designed an app called Seasons which will allow people to control the temperature of their electric blankets via Bluetooth using their iPhone While taking the course he looked for problems he could solve in his community and that’s how he came up with the idea “I wanted to create an easier and safer way for people of all ages to use electric blankets” says Letshae While the app is still in the prototype stage he hopes he’ll see it come to fruition one day Meanwhile Letshae is planning his next steps He has continued to learn about coding beyond the course just by being curious and researching online but he is considering returning to school for a degree in computer science or information technology “Education sets a foundation to elevate myself to achieve my goals” Detroit Michigan Detroit In development Ohio native Telayne Keith says “I believe in my students so much and what they’re capable of doing Whether they see it or not I see it” Keith brings a passion for education and community everywhere she goes She’s one of many talented individuals in Detroit who are paving new paths in today’s tech driven world She was a facilitator in the Boys & Girls Clubs of Southeastern Michigan BGCSM teaching the principles of human centered design and app prototyping In July 2021 Apple teamed up with BGCSM and Grow Detroit’s Young Talent GDYT to build a program for students to develop skills for job opportunities and higher education The six week Code to Career program brought together a cohort of 20 students from ages 18 through 24 to take on community challenges in sustainable fashion and mobility As a facilitator Keith incorporated Apple’s Challenge Based Learning CBL — an approach to leveraging technology to solve real world problems — and guided groups of students to identify community needs and develop creative solutions Keith says “We can’t build on what we already have without expanding what we know Curiosity is so important” Her students were able to realize their inner\n",
      "\n",
      "creative potential and how they can each make a difference Keith reminisces about her own upbringing and how her mother used methods similiar to those of CBL to encourage finding answers through research and field trips to museums Keith says “Education isn’t necessarily four walls and a book it’s what you learn from the people around you who don’t look or think like you” Even though her students didn’t have coding experience they were confidently presenting their app prototypes to judges and Michigan legislators by the end of the program Students were able to take their problem solving skills and collaboration experience and impact their communities Other students continued on to join the Apple Developer Academy Foundation Program — a monthlong program and intro to coding and design — or even apply to the academy’s yearlong program The Apple Developer Academy is a powerful engine of growth for Detroit It’s a hub of entrepreneurship and creativity that provides training for students to be part of the iOS app economy Keith’s passions led her to join the academy as a user experience and user interface UX/UI design mentor to guide and inspire students toward new opportunities in technology She carried this drive to Kent State graduating with a master’s degree in UX/UI in August 2022 From the BGCSM to the Apple Developer Academy the transformational power of technology is helping to champion even more talent in Detroit Keith believes “There’s always a way to carve out your own way through life And education makes that possible” Keith and the Apple Professional Learning Specialists in the BGCSM are fostering a cycle of positive development across communities in Detroit Apple Developer Academy students are returning to their alma maters to share their journeys and inspire younger generations GDYT intends to adopt and organically expand BGCSM’s six week Code to Career program into a yearlong engagement for K–12 students For Keith “Education is truly power” and education empowers each and every community member to develop an even greater Detroit Ottawa Canada Resources from the source First Nations history was until recently virtually absent from curricula in Canada The historic and ongoing regulations of the 1876 Indian Act — which attempted to assimilate a vast varied population of First Nations people into non–First Nations society — and the impact of residential schools that had suppressed 150000 children from expressing their culture for generations were often overlooked The last Canadian residential school closed in 1997 further fueling the movement toward teaching more First Nations culture and history today In 2015 the Assembly of First Nations AFN gathered First Nations education leaders across Canada from coast to coast to coast The AFN showcased a collection of artifacts residential school maps and other materials to help educators teach Canadian history through a First Nations lens Demand for this collection was overwhelming Apple was inspired to kindle a partnership with the AFN to increase educational access for Indigenous and non Indigenous students AFN’s Director of Languages and Learning and a member of Rama First Nations Renee St Germain says “Teachers and students struggle for reliable resources around culture and history” She’s part of the ongoing project with Apple to make available digital resources related to First Nations history The result is a downloadable resource providing hands on educational tools on First Nations’ rights culture and history The free It’s Our Time The AFN Educational Toolkit includes a growing collection of interactive Apple Books that support Indigenous and non Indigenous educators in embedding new perspectives into their classrooms and fostering a spirit of cooperation understanding and action St Germain says “Education is fundamental in addressing large issues eliminating systemic racism and discrimination We all go through education and the system needs to be changed to properly support today’s society and cultures” Apple has helped the AFN develop 15 Apple Books in English and in French Today the combined efforts of Apple Distinguished Educators Apple’s Community Education Initiative pedagogical experts Indigenous education leaders and advocacy organizations continue to empower educators in teaching First Nations history St Germain believes “There’s no bad time to start the conversation for all people regardless of age” Teachers are finally able to integrate First Nations into curricula effectively and spark more dialogue around this sensitive history She says “Equity is at the forefront of everything the AFN does and the toolkit is First Nations–led” She emphasizes the importance for First Nations students to see themselves accurately represented “There are First Nations students in almost every classroom” Systemic change is growing across Canada and the toolkit is building more momentum to make education more equitable for First Nations students and future generations St Germain now works on partnerships with school boards to expand the toolkit’s reach Because First Nations people are diverse Apple and the AFN continue to work with First Nations education leaders to develop region specific editions of the toolkit to better reflect respective traditions languages and cultures According to St Germain there’s more work to be done for First Nations people — from housing to equal rights to cultural safety for students and teachers Education is part of the process As she says “If we can’t find equity in education where else can we find it” Sichuan China Tradition meets technology Ya’an Sichuan is home to the earliest tea plantations ever recorded in written Chinese The city’s four rivers and surrounding peaks form an ideal environment for growing tea And its world renowned homegrown tea is soon to be matched by its invaluable homegrown talent In 2015 Apple\n",
      "\n",
      "began supporting the China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation CFPA to help organize farmers into cooperatives to train them to sell their products more efficiently Cooperative leaders help develop farmers’ skillsets and promote entrepreneurial growth across China’s e commerce ecosystem And in 2020 Apple supported the CFPA in establishing the Mengdingshan Cooperative Development Institute to support digital skills training for more than a thousand farmers’ cooperative leaders every year Cooperative director Ying Wang learned how to utilize technology and devices like iPad to farm smarter She says that everything used to be done with paper notes and iPad made it easier to learn the information and skills needed to improve tea production Many of the farmers who enter the institute have never seen or used tablets before leaders like Wang motivate them to learn because she believes technology is empowering for the community “Cooperative directors are like seeds in communities taking root and sprouting” Wang echoes her teacher’s words when considering the impact of education The institute incorporates a wide ranging curriculum — from seasonal produce efficiencies and supply chain knowledge to marketing and ultimately how to better sell products Farmers and entrepreneurs are able to leverage their newfound digital skills to grow even better tea for export and thrive in their local economies Wang continues “We’re in the age of technology and information it’s not the traditional agricultural era anymore Training our talents helps us achieve transformation” Before the institute many young people in Wang’s village typically left for the cities in search of opportunities Now they’re choosing to stay in their villages because of thriving industry standards access to innovative technology and more practical training Wang is thankful that young people are staying and she’s hopeful that new talent will arrive in the village to help build a more prosperous community together The CFPA is expanding the scale of the institute’s best practices to rural areas in more provinces Wang says “Education has an influence on every step we take on the journey of our life” As cooperative director Wang studies and researches ways to better manage her cooperative and unite members As a result income for cooperative members has increased and their digital skills are continually improving the quality of product Ya’an’s reputation for tea is growing more and more because of each and every talented individual Wang believes “When we are born everyone is the same nobody knows anything It is only education that brings you the ability to create who you are Then you are safe enough to swim around and enjoy your own journey” Birmingham Alabama Communities on the rise There’s a saying “The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago the second best time is now” And in Birmingham Alabama Ed Farm intends to grow digital skills and talent across the tech field for generations to come In early 2020 Apple partnered with Birmingham City Schools the Alabama Power Foundation and TechBirmingham to launch Ed Farm to foster educational equity and

discovered information about Ed Farm on social media and it piqued her interest She says “You can’t go wrong with learning something new” when describing her Pathways experience and how she gained more knowledge about code and technology She began to apply these digital skills toward a new career as a business analyst Hackworth’s role isn’t rooted in writing a coding language it’s to speak the language that involves code as she works as a liaison between technology and business teams Ed Farm doesn’t just teach people how to code it demonstrates awareness that the tech field has multiple paths — from product owners to project managers to business analysts like Hackworth and more She firmly believes that “education will help you grow The more you know the more you grow” Ed Farm’s

      "Pro was specifically designed to be used without glasses If you wear glasses for vision correction you may need to purchase ZEISS Optical Inserts They magnetically attach to Apple Vision Pro to provide precise viewing for those who need glasses or certain contacts When you order Apple Vision Pro we’ll ask you a series of vision questions Your answers will determine whether or not you need optical inserts Generally speaking if you don’t wear any vision correction options you likely won’t need ZEISS Optical Inserts The same is true if you wear soft contact lenses to correct your distance vision since Apple Vision Pro works well with most soft contact lenses For the best Apple Vision Pro experience right out of the box it’s important to answer all the vision questions correctly and to add optical inserts to your Apple Vision Pro order if they are recommended This will ensure that the Light Seal you get is compatible with your optical inserts If you buy optical inserts later you may need to purchase a new Light Seal Once we determine that you need ZEISS Optical Inserts you can complete your purchase and upload your prescription to ZEISS If you need more time we’ll also send you

All backed by ongoing support to give you much needed peace of mind Talk to an Expert Advancing equity today An equitable world is a better world So we’re expanding opportunities for Black Hispanic/Latinx and Indigenous communities around the world in three key areas education economic empowerment and criminal justice reform Because creating meaningful change takes all of us Education that powers possibility We’re increasing support for minority serving institutions and programs that foster skill building technology training and career growth Because with more resources more is possible Filmmakers propelled by purpose Dr Tytianna Ringstaff believes creativity is a catalyst for change As the Artistic Director of the Black Film Institute at Simmons College of Kentucky a Historically Black College and University HBCU in Louisville she and other faculty are providing students with a platform to pursue their passion for filmmaking “We’re using storytelling to resurrect untold narratives about the Black experience As a catalyst for change we use art for activism to ignite critical conversations and disrupt the injustices we collectively experience” says Dr Ringstaff Apple has invested $25 million as a founding partner of the Propel Center a first of its kind global innovation and learning hub that supports all HBCUs With a grant from Propel Simmons’s Black Film Institute has created programming that gives its students hands on experience making films — including writing filming directing producing editing and marketing them ”We want to make sure our students are leaving with that passion and authenticity — and the\n",

      "opportunity to become a vehicle for social change and transformation through their own story and their own lens” adds Dr Ringstaff Using Mac iPad and iPhone devices as well as Final Cut Pro and iMovie editing software the students produced and filmed the documentary series Raising Simmons Treading the Lanes The series pilot tells the story of 11 Black jockeys who raced in the first Kentucky Derby ”To me it was very shocking” says Kristen Gray a student who worked on the film “These first jockeys were formerly enslaved They were some of America’s very first athletes That story gets overlooked” By creating these opportunities Simmons College of Kentucky is ensuring that Black history is elevated and that more students like Gray are better positioned to pursue film careers ”I plan to continue to write and produce my short films” she says ”I’ve even written a number of short horror films I feel more confident not only in writing but in filming directing and editing” A digital approach to preserving culture In Mexico Apple has been working closely with educational institutions across the country to help set up and launch iOS Development Labs — bringing coding with the programming language Swift to students and preparing them for careers in Mexico’s iOS app economy Among these institutions is the Wixárika School of Higher Secondary Education The Wixáritari are the largest Indigenous community in Jalisco Mexico As the world around them continues to digitize they have been forced to make tough decisions including leaving their close knit community in search of educational and economic opportunities in distant cities To help ensure that the Wixáritari gain the professional skills they need while also preserving ties to their community iOS Development Labs at the Universidad de Guadalajara UdeG along with regional partner Enactus is helping them learn how to design create and code their own apps “We have so much talent around us all the time Our mindset is always about creating opportunities for more and more people” says Jesús Esparza President of Enactus Mexico In April 2023 six students and two teachers from the Wixárika School were invited to the lab at the Centro Universitario de Arte Arquitectura y Diseño CUAAD campus of UdeG for coding training to support educational and economic opportunities in the Wixárika community There the students and teachers learned how to use iPad and Mac devices and gained foundational coding skills with Swift Playgrounds After their training they passed on their knowledge to others in their community Rafael Cázares Administrator for the UdeG iOS lab is excited by the opportunities that coding has provided the students “Now they want to solve all problems through apps” he says “They see a problem and know they can make a difference It’s empowered them” Teaching tradition through tech There are around 450000 Cherokee Nation citizens in the world but only about 2000 are fluent Cherokee speakers — and most are over 70 years old “Our language is very ancient but it holds the keys to the future and where we want to go” says Deputy Principal Chief Bryan Warner of the Cherokee Nation “If you get to that last fluent language speaker and that person passes you can hear a way of life ending That is something we do not want to see here” To help keep the Cherokee language alive the Cherokee Immersion Charter School opened in 2002 The Oklahoma school teaches math music and other subjects to kindergarten through eighth grade students in their ancestral language Though many students have parents and grandparents who were precluded from speaking Cherokee because of assimilation policies at the Cherokee school students speak their native language freely and proudly “Without this school we wouldn’t learn the language Without the language our traditions could die out our culture could die out Without our language we cannot really say we’re Cherokee” says seventh grader Kannon Lane To support the school’s efforts Apple donated iPad and Mac devices And Apple’s Community Education Initiative team hosted an onsite training to help members of the school staff learn how to use iPad devices to make impactful learning content The school is also expanding opportunities for its students through coding “Coding makes more possible” says Deputy Chief Warner “I imagine the day someone says to me ‘Have you seen this new language app It’s from a student who started out at our school They developed it’ There are tears that can be shed for many different reasons but those tears would be joyful because I believe that our ancestors would be happy” Coding with community in mind Throughout his life Jerome Warfield has held many roles Pharmaceutical sales rep Parole officer Pastor But at 57 years old he never envisioned adding coder to that list — until he heard about Detroit’s Apple Developer Academy That’s when Pastor Warfield who was born and raised in Detroit realized he could be a force for change within his community by learning to code Historically the home of automotive engineering Detroit now has a growing class of entrepreneurs who are pioneering a new future of digital innovation The Developer Academy which has more than 15 locations around the world brought its program to downtown Detroit — its first ever US location — through a partnership with Michigan State University MSU The academy now reaches nearly 750 participants from the Detroit metropolitan area every year with both short term and long term programs that teach the fundamentals of coding design project management marketing and iOS app development With its\n",

      "wealth of minority owned businesses the Detroit area was an obvious choice for a new Developer Academy location And for Pastor Warfield attending the program was a transformative experience “At the Developer Academy I was able to collaborate with people who came from completely different backgrounds than myself They expanded my thinking and understanding of what’s possible” says Pastor Warfield The Developer Academy is also committed to helping public high school seniors continue their education by providing them with stipends to attend the academy “This program changes the trajectory of individuals who now have access to technology” says Pastor Warfield “It opens up a whole new world for those of us who have felt shut out of the industry” The success of the Developer Academy is evident in its students Pastor Warfield plans to apply what he’s learned to help senior citizens and formerly incarcerated people Other alumni have built healthcare and cryptocurrency apps And still others have been hired as Developer Academy mentors All of which shows how learning to code has the power to benefit both people and communities in significant ways A new state of the arts in the UK In the United Kingdom Apple’s partnership with the Southbank Centre is providing emerging Black creatives with the opportunity to showcase their talents at the country’s largest multi arts center “It’s not about teaching creativity It’s about empowering it” says Alexandra Brierley Director of Creative Learning at the Southbank Centre Apple’s collaboration with the Southbank Centre began with a pilot project called Photo Fantastic As part of the pilot 15 emerging Black photographers from London produced over 4000 photographs using Apple technology Their work was featured at the Southbank Centre — and many of them won awards and recognition for their art The Southbank Centre partnership has since expanded to include the Reframe project Spanning London Manchester and Birmingham Reframe provides 21 secondary schools with creative curricula to help spark a passion for creativity in the next generation Reframe also includes an industry led residency program that helps 80 Black artists develop their skills in photography music and filmmaking Participants are given access to a suite of Apple technology to create their art including iPhone MacBook and iMac devices and are also mentored by Apple creative professionals At the program’s culmination they exhibit their work at the Southbank Centre with their program peers other creatives and members of the press and public in attendance ”If you don’t feel like you are part of a creative sector that reflects and represents your community that has a huge impact on confidence” says Brierley “This program is an investment in the whole talent pipeline from school to early career and beyond” After the program ends support for the artists continues This includes long term mentorship and connection to a growing alumni network Ultimately these efforts make a positive impact not only on the artists but on the industry as a whole within reach Higher learning within reach Dr Amanda Quintero believes that access to education shouldn’t happen by chance The daughter of immigrant parents Dr Quintero didn’t have access to higher education and the expectation was that she’d find a job after finishing high school It wasn’t until Dr Quintero’s last semester of her senior year that a substitute teacher encouraged her to apply to university That chance encounter changed Dr Quintero’s entire trajectory It was the moment she started to believe that she had what it took — that she belonged Today Dr Quintero dedicates her career to ensuring that other first generation college students at Hispanic Serving Institutions HSIs have the same opportunities she had She serves as the Senior Advisor to the President for Inclusive Excellence and as the Equity Innovation Officer of the Global HSI Equity Innovation Hub at California State University Northridge Launched in partnership with Apple the Global HSI Equity Innovation Hub is working to transform HSIs nationally to increase student success and equip Hispanic/Latinx and other minoritized and historically excluded students with skills to enter careers in science technology engineering arts and math STEAM “It’s a full circle of giving back investing in diverse talent with the very communities that many of the students come from to disrupt intergenerational inequity” says Dr Quintero In addition to technology and grants Apple is providing experts to help design educational spaces and programming positioning learners for success in college and in the workforce The goal is to move the needle on equipping a largely first generation student population with the educational experiences and skills they need to become first generation professionals in STEAM fields The Global HSI Equity Innovation Hub is making this happen by connecting HSIs to resources thought leaders and one another sharing what works to accelerate educational equity all of which leads to a more inclusive and diverse workforce The Global HSI Equity Innovation Hub signifies a shift in the paradigm from what students must do to be successful to what HSIs must do to serve students intentionally It puts the onus on leadership to shine an equity lens on their structures policies and practices It empowers students faculty and staff to transform institutions which Dr Quintero says is key to an effective equity centered approach to education The other key is engaging the families of first generation college students who are often disconnected from campus life “The first time my family ever set foot on a college campus was the day of my graduation” says Dr Quintero “And I don’t want that to be the experience of\n",

forward For too long Beatriz Acevedo and Mary Hernandez heard stories from people in the Hispanic/Latinx communities about keeping their money under a mattress — or stashed away in a safe in their homes They did this because the US financial system has historically failed to understand and serve their needs Acevedo and Hernandez knew they wanted to rectify this wrong by supporting their community in taking control of its finances So along with Xavier Gutierrez they founded SUMA Wealth The Latina led financial technology company with Chief Operations Officer Hernandez Chief Executive Officer Acevedo and Chief Strategy and Business Development Officer Daniela Corrente first focused on gaining their community’s trust “We want the Latino community to know this company is built by people like you and for you” says Hernandez Corrente adds “Many institutions think because they put a sign in Spanish they are going to attract people from the Latino community but that’s not what inclusivity means” For its part SUMA Wealth is both an app and website that speaks directly to Hispanic/Latinx communities and their financial needs in culturally relevant and fun ways A “dinero toolkit“ offers tips like how to pay off credit cards while another section of the site provides answers to “401 qué“ questions The startup receives support from Apple partner VamosVentures which funds diverse entrepreneurs with groundbreaking ideas Just over a year after launching SUMA reaches more than five million users each month And within three months of starting the program these users go from no savings to an average of $500 in emergency savings “Ultimately we want SUMA to be that all in one financial platform that fully supports our community at building generational wealth” says Acevedo of community Bold solutions born of community For Maria Castellon her business isn’t just about creating great products It’s about prioritizing a safe environment for her employees to create these products After immigrating to the United States from Mexico Castellon witnessed hazardous conditions while working her way up through the manufacturing industry So she dedicated herself to creating a better business model That model turned into Bench Tek Solutions a Silicon Valley–based manufacturing company that creates sustainably designed workplace and laboratory furniture As the company grew Castellon its CEO worked to adopt more sustainable practices To help achieve this she applied to the Apple Impact Accelerator program The 12 week virtual program is designed to help scale US based Black Hispanic/Latinx and Native/Indigenous owned businesses innovating in Apple’s key environmental focus areas renewable energy carbon removal recycling innovation and smarter chemistry “The Accelerator was both a personal and professional opportunity for me to grow” says Castellon “The one on one mentorship was extremely impactful and my mentor really inspired me to keep working on my goals” Since completing the program Castellon and her team have reduced Bench Tek’s carbon footprint and increased its long term sustainability As part of these efforts they asked fellow Impact Accelerator alumnus and solar roofing company Simmitri Inc to install solar panels at Bench Tek “We were interested in developing strategies and investing in technology like fiber optic lasers and solar for increasing energy efficiency in our manufacturing We also wanted to utilize these strategies for more energy efficient innovative furniture design” she says Bench Tek’s success has elevated Hispanic/Latinx representation in Silicon Valley and the environmental sector Castellon adds “I love that a company such as Apple is really investing their resources and time and making an impact to create equality and inclusion for vendors like us who never had these chances before” Apps made by everyone For everyone Founders from underrepresented communities face unique challenges especially when starting and leading technology companies Apple Entrepreneur Camp was created to help support these founders and their organizations with app driven businesses The camp experience begins with an immersive technology lab where participants receive one on one code level guidance from Apple experts and engineers to help them significantly accelerate their apps Along the way they get mentorship inspiration and insights from top Apple leaders They also get one year of free membership in the Apple Developer Program that includes access to beta software advanced app capabilities extensive beta testing tools and app analytics Participants are developing more than just apps — they’re developing long lasting relationships too Entrepreneur Camp alumni become part of a growing community of world class leaders working across tech business and social impact to support each other through the entrepreneurial journey They also receive ongoing support from an Apple Developer representative who is an expert on the developer ecosystem as they build the next generation of cutting edge apps Criminal justice rooted in reform We’re standing up for what’s right by supporting organizations committed to transforming the criminal justice system Changing lives by changing systems Carly Stanley knew that things needed to change The criminal legal system that systemically targeted Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples needed to change The child protection services that separated babies children and young people from their culture and community needed to change And Stanley who had witnessed these injustices firsthand believed she could fight for that change “It’s not a child protection system because the system doesn’t protect children It’s not a criminal justice system because the system isn’t just” says Stanley So Stanley and her husband Keenan Mundine created the Australian Aboriginal community–led nonprofit Deadly Connections which started\n",
      "\n",
      "in Sydney as an outreach program for Aboriginal young people who were frequently targeted by police “The vision of Deadly Connections is to address systemic racial disparities through advocacy and various initiatives and to continue to dismantle and disrupt the harmful systems that have caused and continue to cause a lot of pain for our community” says Stanley Her outreach initially consisted of playing sports with the kids to help keep them engaged and connected From there Deadly Connections grew into an advocacy and support organization for adults and children affected by the child protection and criminal legal systems “The prison experience is detrimental not only for the individual but for the whole family and community That’s why everything we do is grounded in culture and community We know culture is a protective factor” says Stanley Deadly Connections’ grassroots support includes logistical assistance for families such as ensuring that people can get to their appointments And the nonprofit supported by an Apple grant helps kids and young people stay connected to their culture with one on one mentoring group mentoring and pop up community events The organization is also addressing systemic issues at the policy level including supporting Raise the Age a national campaign striving to stop Australia from locking up young children and sending them to prison Currently children as young as 10 can be incarcerated in Australia younger than the age set by most other countries Stanley is advocating for all of these changes so that Aboriginal peoples don’t just survive but thrive Painting new paths In Louisiana kids as young as 10 can be arrested prosecuted and incarcerated in the juvenile justice system And 95 percent of these children are Black They are exposed to the traumas of incarceration and denied the educational and development opportunities that every child deserves For Journey Allen this makes her work as the Director of Youth Education at Arts New Orleans for its Young Artist Movement YAM Diversion Program that much more important It’s why she works tirelessly to be a source of healing and guidance for system involved youth so they can find a path toward a brighter future “I really believe in the power of creativity and how it can care for and heal our young people” says Allen YAM cofounded by Judge Arthur Hunter Jr in 2021 acts as an alternative to prosecution for children and youth with nonviolent offenses Apple has partnered with Arts New Orleans a nonprofit organization that supports arts and culture around the city to take a stand against the incarceration of children by increasing support for the program YAM is the only arts based diversion program offered through the Orleans Parish District Attorney’s Office After completion of the program youths’ cases are dismissed Allen has witnessed firsthand how working with young people through the arts gives them a second chance as well as a sense of hope and possibility “A lot of the kids that come through the diversion program have a true desire to do well” she says “They’re just still searching for that thing that will capture their attention” One such outlet is mural painting which has quickly become one of the youths’ favorite forms of creative expression Local businesses nonprofit organizations and city agencies commission these projects and the kids gain real world experience working with clients They use iPad devices to film the mural making process and have even used digital animation software on iPad to project their mural designs onto city buildings In addition to broadening their capabilities as artists YAM helps its participants leverage art to speak to the issues directly affecting their communities “The YAM program encouraged us to help people and shed light on different topics” says Aliyah Pflueger a YAM student artist who applied to the program as a way to help develop her creative abilities “We have a voice through this program to say something People want to hear what kids have to say and what’s going on around them We’re telling our story and helping our community” Funding the front lines of change Black Hispanic/Latinx and Indigenous communities continue to be disproportionately harmed by disparities in the criminal justice system Black Americans are incarcerated in state prisons at nearly five times the rate of white Americans Latin Americans are incarcerated at 13 times the rate of white Americans and Native Americans are incarcerated at a rate 38 percent higher than the national average — the highest rate of any demographic That’s why Apple continues to support and donate to organizations dedicating their time talents and resources to fight for systems that serve everyone equally Our grant projects in Australia support Indigenous owned and ‑operated efforts such as the Art Gallery of New South Wales NSW Djamu Youth Justice Program which supports Indigenous young people impacted by the justice system through art and culture Programming includes creative workshops artistic projects and discussions with local artists Apple is also donating to domestic groups whose work is laying the foundation for meaningful reform within the United States Our grant recipients include the following groups The Anti Recidivism Coalition ARC works to end mass incarceration in California by empowering formerly and currently incarcerated people through a support network comprehensive reentry services — including transitional housing clinical therapy case management and workforce development — and grassroots policy advocacy to create a more just and equitable criminal justice system for all people Turn2U Inc’s The Last Mile program TLM offers

Apple 2030A plan as innovative as our products And designing products you love Apple 2030 is our plan to do both A detailed approach Design our products with recycled and renewable materials1 Our Approach Recycled and renewable materials often carry a lighter footprint than mined materials By sourcing more recycled and renewable content we can help to one day end our reliance on mining Our Progress 22% of the materials we shipped in Apple products came from recycled and renewable sources2 Source all manufacturing electricity from clean energy Our Approach Most of our carbon footprint comes from the electricity used to manufacture our products So our suppliers are transitioning to electricity generated from solar wind and other renewable sources Our Progress Over 320 of our suppliers have already committed to using 100% renewable electricity by 2030 Package and ship our products with less emissions Match 100% of our products’ energy use with clean electricity5 Our Approach We’re investing in global renewable energy projects that help address the electricity our products use And we’re making these products even more energy efficient Our Progress We’re matching 100% of the expected electricity use for Apple Watch models by investing in projects like the IP Radian Solar project6 Maximize the materials we recover from recycled products Our progress by the numbers We introduced our most significant product emissions reductions to date with the 2023 Apple Watch lineup9 Over 55% reduction in CO₂e emissions across our carbon footprint since 2015 185M

packages is common now and according to some stories Apple may or may not believe you and reimburse you Always pick up in the store DISAPPOINTED My son had bought a brand new phone from working at the library It was an iPhone XR A year later right after the warranty expired his Face ID feature didn’t work anymore We called customer service and we were put on hold and were talking to many different people for hours trying to figure out the issue until the Apple “Senior Advisor” called it a hardware malfunction She said that it won’t get fixed and that we would have to pay $399 dollars for a replacement Is this some kind of joke Or even better a pyramid scheme that as soon as the warranty runs out let’s destroy an innocent kids phone so that the kids parents will buy him the new phone DON’T EVER BUT FROM APPLE It’s nothing but a scam I was disappointed especially because this wasn’t my first Apple product but my sons first Apple product Apple account balance is useless Unprofessional Apple staff and DO NOT deposit your Apple gift card balance into your Apple account I was told I could use my Apple account balance to pay for my iPhone repair but when it was done the second day I was told I couldnt pay from my Apple account balance However I could have paid for the repair if I hadnt deposited my Apple gift card balance into my account And eventually I paid by my own credit card and left the Apple account balance unused In short once you deposit your gift card into your Apple account balance it will have very limited usage You cant use it combined with installment cant use it for repair Thats just from what I know Come on it is already 2022 how can Apple hasnt fixed it How can staffs answers be so confusing App Privacy The developer Apple indicated

can provide your patients with an early indication that further evaluation may be warranted Irregular rhythm notifications use the optical heart sensor to detect the pulse wave at the wrist and look for variability in beat‑to‑beat intervals when the user is at rest If the algorithm repeatedly detects an irregular rhythm suggestive of AFib your patient will receive a notification and the date time and beat‑to‑beat heart rate will be recorded in the Health app In a clinical study using an FDA‑cleared patch ECG as a reference device the irregular rhythm notification feature demonstrated a
